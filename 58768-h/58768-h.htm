<h2>
PREFACE.
</h2>

<p>
It has been said that a man often writes his book
first, his preface last. The author of this work is
no exception to the general rule. These volumes
contain an account of a journey on horseback
through Asia Minor. I was five months in that
country, and traversed a district extending
over 2000 miles. My limited leave of absence
prevented me from staying more than a few
days at the important towns which lay on the
route.
</p>

<p>
Although unable to learn so much as was to be
desired of the ways and mode of life of the various
inhabitants of Anatolia, I had the opportunity of
talking to every class of society with reference to
the questions of the day—the Conference, and
the impending war with Russia. Pachas, farmers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vi' name='Page_vi' href='#Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
peasants, all of them had something to say about
these subjects.
</p>

<p>
I met people of many different races: Turks,
Armenians, Greeks, Turkomans, Circassians,
Kurds, and Persians. They almost invariably
received me very hospitably.
</p>

<p>
The remarks which were made by the Mohammedans
about the Christians, and by the Armenians
about the Turks and Russians, sometimes
interested me. I have thought that they might
interest the public.
</p>

<p>
The impression formed in my own mind as to
the probable result of the war between Russia and
Turkey was decidedly unfavourable to the latter
power. Since this work has been written the
soldiers of the Crescent have gallantly withstood
their foe. My reasons for arriving at the above-mentioned
opinion will be found in these
volumes. They merely contain a sort of verbal
photograph—if the reader will allow me to use
the expression—of what I saw and heard during
the journey.
</p>

<p>
A few official reports, referring to the treatment
of the members of the United Greek Christians
by the Russian authorities will be seen in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vii' name='Page_vii' href='#Page_vii'>vii</a></span>
Appendices, and amongst other matter a document
brought to England by two Circassian Chiefs.
It relates to the invasion of Circassia by the
Russians. There are also some march routes
and descriptions of various districts, taken and
translated from different military works.

<h2>
INTRODUCTION.
</h2>

<p>
It was the autumn of 1876: I had not as yet
determined where to spend my winter leave of
absence. There was a great deal of excitement in
England; the news of some terrible massacres in
Bulgaria had thoroughly aroused the public. The
indignation against the perpetrators of these
awful crimes became still more violent, when it
was remembered that the Turkish Government
had repudiated its loans, and that more than a
hundred millions sterling had gone for ever from
the pockets of the British tax-payer. This was
very annoying.
</p>

<p>
We were on the eve of an important election.<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
Some people declared that our Government might
have prevented the massacres in Bulgaria; others,
that an ostentatious protection had been shown to
Turkey, and that Europe had been wantonly disturbed
through the instrumentality of our Ministry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_x' name='Page_x' href='#Page_x'>x</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Illustrious statesmen, who were solacing themselves
after the toils of the session, by meandering
through the rural districts on bicycles, or by
felling timber in sylvan groves, hurried up to
town.
</p>

<p>
Two letters appeared in the columns of the
leading journal signed by gentlemen belonging to
the Church of England, saying that they had seen
Christians impaled by the Turks.
</p>

<p>
Pamphlets were written and speeches made in
which the subjects of the Sultan were held
up to universal execration. Several distinguished
Russians, who happened at that time to be in
England, threw oil on the flames which had been
kindled.
</p>

<p>
Ladies, like Madame de Lievens, of whom the
late Duke of Wellington wrote,<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> went from <i>salon</i>
to <i>salon</i> and extolled the Christian motives of the
Tzar. This feminine eloquence proved too much
for a few of our legislators, who, like Lord Grey
in the year 1829, entertained some old opposition
opinions of Mr. Fox's, that "the Turks ought to
be driven out of Europe."
</p>

<p>
It was difficult to arrive at the truth amidst all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xi' name='Page_xi' href='#Page_xi'>xi</a></span>
the turmoil which prevailed. Were the Turks
such awful scoundrels? Had the reverend gentlemen,
to whom I have already alluded, really seen
Christians impaled, or were these clergymen under
the influence of a hallucination? There was one
way to satisfy my own mind as to whether the
subjects of the Porte were so cruel as they had
been described. I determined to travel in Asia
Minor; for there I should be with Turks who are
far removed from any European supervision.
Should I not behold Christians impaled and wriggling
like worms on hooks in every high road
of Armenia, or find an Inquisition and a weekly
<i>auto da fé</i> the amusement of the Mohammedans at
Van?
</p>

<p>
Judging from the pamphlets which were continually
being written about the inhuman nature
of the Turks, this was not at all improbable. I
should also have the opportunity of seeing something
of the country between the Russo-Turkish
frontier and Scutari.
</p>

<p>
It was the beginning of November. My leave
of absence would commence towards the middle
of the month. It was time to make preparations
for the journey. On this occasion I determined
to take an English servant, a faithful fellow, who
had been with me in many parts of the world.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xii' name='Page_xii' href='#Page_xii'>xii</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Before leaving London I thought that it might
be as well to write to the Turkish Ambassador,
and ask him if there would be any objection on
the part of the authorities in Constantinople to
my proposed journey in Asia Minor, at the same
time saying that in the event of my obtaining the
permission to travel in Anatolia, I should be
much obliged to His Excellency if he could supply
me with the requisite passport. To this letter I
received, by return of post, the most courteous
reply. I was informed that every Englishman
could travel where he liked in the Turkish Empire,
and that nothing was required but the ordinary
foreign office passport, one of which His Excellency
enclosed.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime I read all the books I could
find which treated of Asia Minor. According to
the works of those travellers who have been to
Armenia in the winter, the cold would be very
great. Indeed Tournefort found the wells in
Erzeroum frozen over in July. Milner in his
"History of the Turkish Empire," remarks of the
mountainous district in Armenia, "Throughout
this high region no one thinks, except under most
urgent necessity, of travelling for eight months in
the year, owing to the snow, ice, and intense
cold."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xiii' name='Page_xiii' href='#Page_xiii'>xiii</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Regimental duty detained me in England during
the summer. I could only avail myself of the
winter for my journey. I had experienced the
cold of the Kirghiz steppes in December and
January, 1876, and was of opinion that the clothes
which would keep a man alive in the deserts of
Tartary, would more than protect him against the
climate of Kurdistan. For shooting purposes I
determined to take a little single Express rifle,
made by Henry, and a No. 12 smooth-bore. A
small stock of medicines was put in my saddle-bags
in the event of any illness on the road.
</p>

<p>
My arrangements were completed. I was
ready to start.

walking down those very uncomfortable steps
which lead to the Calais boat. A rough passage
with a number of Gauls, who all talked
loud at starting, but whose conversation gradually
died away in mournful strains, and we
steamed into Calais harbour; five hours later I
was having my luggage examined in the waiting-room
in Paris.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, they ain't found the cartridges, for I took
good care to mix them up with the medicine
bottles," whispered my servant Radford, as he
mounted the box of our fiacre, and I drove away
to a hotel, somewhat relieved in my mind, as I
was not quite sure whether carrying loaded cartridges
is permitted on the Chemin de Fer du
Nord. I did not remain long in Paris. The
2000 miles ride which lay before me across Asia
Minor would take up every day of my leave.
There was no time to lose, and in a very few
hours I was in a railway station taking tickets
for Marseilles. The night mail was just about to
start. There were none but first-class carriages.
The result was that servants and masters had
to travel together.
</p>

<p>
"You will sit in that carriage," said an obese
and rubicund Englishman to his groom, pointing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
to my compartment; "I cannot go with servants;"—and
he entered another carriage. Farther
on I saw the portly personage in the refreshment-room
at Dijon. He was talking to a little Frenchman,
and apparently on the best of terms with him.
The sound of their voices was mingled with the
jingling of glasses and the clinking of knives and
forks. Every one was eating as fast as he could.
The waiters were serving the different travellers
with lightning rapidity, and the proprietor of the
buffet was calling out from time to time in a deep
bass voice,—
</p>

<p>
"<span lang="fr_FR">Ne vous pressez pas, messieurs. Il y a
encore 10 minutes avant le départ du train.</span>"
</p>

<p>
"Who is the little man?" I inquired of a talkative
Yankee who was sitting by my side during
the <i><span lang="fr_FR">table d'hôte</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
"He, sir? He is my cook, and I am taking
him with me to Nice."
</p>

<p>
The obese Englishman heard the remark, and
became more rubicund than before.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon I have collapsed him," muttered the
American. "If I have to travel with his darned
servant, I don't see why he should not travel
with mine."
</p>

<p>
The train rattled on. Each man in our crowded
compartment tried to compose himself to sleep;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
the red light from the American's cigar gradually
died away, and the individual himself, coolly
lolling his head on his neighbour's shoulder, sank
into semi-unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
The morn broke bright and glorious. Winter
was left behind; we were in the land of orange-trees
and olives.
</p>

<p>
The steamer for Constantinople started at four
o'clock that afternoon, so we drove straight from
the station in Marseilles to the harbour. Here I
found a splendid vessel belonging to Les Messageries
Maritimes, and which was already getting
up steam. The captain was bustling about, giving
orders. The crew were hauling in the ponderous
anchors.
</p>

<p>
There were not many passengers on board;
only a silk merchant from Lyons, a rabid republican,
and a pretty Greek girl,—a friend of
Madame Ignatieff, the wife of the Russian
ambassador at Constantinople,—who, after paying
a visit to some friends in Paris, was again on her
way to Constantinople. Our vessel was soon
steaming ahead. She ploughed her way splendidly
through the waters, and hardly a motion could be
perceived inside the spacious saloon which formed
the dining-room of the passengers. We were but
a small party. The captain, a cheery tar who had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
been in every part of the world, and knew more
stories about the unguardedness of the fair sex
than perhaps any other mortal living. The doctor,
a somewhat bilious and elderly gentleman, who
became easily excited on all religious questions,
and gave short dissertations between the courses on
the respective merits of medicine and Christianity.
The silk-merchant, who cursed the empire, and
then informed us that trade had never been so
flourishing as under Napoleon's rule. Presently
he told me in a whisper that some Frenchmen
wished for another Emperor, and he concluded,
with an oath, that if there were, he would head
a revolution and sacrifice his own life—yes, his
own life!—sooner than that the Prince Imperial
should sit upon the throne of France.
</p>

<p>
We steam into the bay of Smyrna; the picturesque
and undulating coast is shaded in a
framework of azure clouds; the sea, blue as lapis
lazuli, is dotted with numerous vessels; flags of
almost every nation in the world float in the
balmy air; the clean white houses, with their
many-coloured wooden shutters, brighten up the
glorious landscape; and boatmen, dressed in garbs
of many hues and fashions, throng the sides of
our vessel.
</p>

<p>
"I am going on shore," said the silk-merchant,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
who was surrounded by a crowd of vociferous
Greeks. "Our steamer will not start for several
hours. Let us dine in a café, and see if the fair
sex in this part of Turkey is as beautiful as some
travellers would have us believe."
</p>

<p>
I accepted his proposal, and we walked through
the streets of Smyrna. The town, clean as it
looked from the harbour, proved to be a hideous
deception. The streets were narrow and dirty,
and the odour which everywhere met our olfactory
nerves, was strongly suggestive of typhus. Women
were seated in the <i>patios</i> or open courts of the
houses, and the Greek ladies in Smyrna are evidently
not shy. They boldly returned the inquisitive
glances of my companion and myself, and
appeared rather pleased than otherwise at our
curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I can't say much for their beauty,"
observed my companion. "They have good eyes
and hair, but all of them look as if they had not
washed their faces for at least a fortnight. Come
along and smoke a Nargileh. If there is one
thing I love, it is a Nargileh, and when I am
inhaling the tobacco I imagine myself to be a
Pacha surrounded by my seraglio."
</p>

<p>
We turned into a café; it was surrounded by
a large garden. Some Greek merchants were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
playing at dominoes; an Italian prima donna,
who might have been any age from seventy
to a hundred, was singing a popular air; men
with game and fish for sale walked up and down,
regardless of interrupting the ancient vocalist, and
offered their wares to the visitors. Presently my
companion moved uneasily in his chair; some
drops of perspiration stood on his forehead, and
his face was becoming rapidly green under the
influence of the Turkish Nargileh.
</p>

<p>
"I think I have had enough," he remarked.
"The room is very hot. <i><span lang="fr_FR">Au revoir.</span></i>" And he
returned to our vessel.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime I proceeded to call upon a
friend in the town. This gentleman informed me
that the Christians and Turks in Smyrna were on
the best of terms; however, he added that certain
papers, believed to be in Russian pay, were constantly
announcing that there would shortly be a
massacre of the Christians; it was said that this was
done to excite bad blood between the two sects.
</p>

<p>
The shrill sound of the steamer's whistle announced
that she was getting up steam. Hastily
retracing my steps, I arrived on board just as the
crew were weighing anchor. The original number
of passengers had by this time received a considerable
addition. Greeks, Armenians, and Turks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
were walking about or lying stretched along the
deck. Women and children were huddled up in
close proximity with the men. A Babel of different
languages was going on around me, and an old
Greek woman was having an animated squabble
with one of the ship's officers, the subject of discussion
being as to whether the ancient female
had paid the proper fare. The French officer
could speak but little Greek, and the shrill-voiced
dame no French; in consequence of this it was
difficult for them to arrive at any satisfactory
solution of the matter.
</p>

<p>
A Pacha, his son, and the chief of the telegraphs,
were the only first-class passengers. However,
four ladies, the Pacha's seraglio, had been accommodated
on the deck; they were reclining on
some cushions in close juxtaposition with their
attendant—a negro. The voice of this sable
gentleman was pitched in a feminine key, and he
was busily engaged in arranging some pillows
beneath the stoutest of the ladies—a comely dame
who would have turned the scale at probably sixteen
stone. Two pointer dogs in a large hamper,
which was directed to a Bey in Constantinople,
added their barking to the general clamour, and
some horses, bound to Stamboul, were fastened
by head-collars to the bulwarks, no horse-boxes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
being provided. Farther on, and towards the
steerage end of the vessel, were 500 recruits,
on their way to Servia, and in high spirits at the
idea of shortly encountering the Russians.
</p>

<p>
It was a lovely evening, and I walked along the
deck with the captain, gazing curiously at his
motley passengers. The stars shone bright, as
became an Eastern clime; a gradually freshening
breeze for the moment had cleared the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have an easy passage," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for good sailors," was the reply; "but
it will be a little rough for those poor women,"—pointing
to the pacha's harem—"and for the
half-clad recruits yonder."
</p>

<p>
The latter did not seem to anticipate the treat
that was in store for them. They were scattered
in groups about the deck, many of them squatting
upon their haunches, and attired for the most
part in rags and many-coloured patchwork.
</p>

<p>
Presently a doleful melody was heard; the dirge
which reached our ears told us of the readiness
of these embryo warriors to meet the foe and die
for the sake of Islam.
</p>

<p>
"They will die quite soon enough," remarked
the captain drily, as the last verse died away.
"Look down there," he added, pointing to the
ship's hold; "our vessel is laden with 300 tons
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
of lead, and once a week for several months past
the steamers belonging to the Messageries Maritimes
have been freighted with a similar cargo.
This is all going to Odessa. It will be odd if
some of the lead does not soon find its way
back to the true believers, in the shape of
bullets."
</p>

<p>
"The Russian Government is putting itself to
great expense," he continued; "however, there are
people so silly as to think that Gortschakoff wishes
for peace; and in spite of all his preparations
they actually believe in the Conference!"
</p>

<p>
The captain now left me, but I remained on
deck. The freshening gale gradually imparted
an oscillating movement to our steamer. The
rain fell in large drops. Some of the sailors
covered the ladies of the harem with an awning.
The horses began to kick, and the dogs in the
hamper to bark. A melancholy groan could
be heard from that part of the vessel appropriated
by the soldiers. The first to succumb
was the fat woman; in despairing tones she
called for assistance. The black attendant rushed
to the rescue and convulsively grasped the lady's
head. It was a funny spectacle—that enormous
pumpkin-shaped face supported by two black
hands. The now hazy moon cast a shadowy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
beam on the negro's countenance: from black it
changed to green; it assumed a diabolical expression.
The vessel lurched; he lost his balance;
dropping his mistress's head, he fell down upon
the pointers. They set up a savage growl. The
eunuch started to his feet; his hair bristled with
alarm; he felt himself all over. However, there
was no damage done, and with a sorrowful mien
he returned to the side of his mistress.

<p>
The following morning my servant awoke me with
the announcement that we had arrived in the
Bosphorus, and that he had not been able to eat
his supper. By this last piece of intelligence he
wished to convey to my mind that the storm had
been more than usually violent. I was soon
dressed, and, going on deck, found it crowded
with interpreters from the different hotels. During
previous sojourns in Constantinople, I had learnt
by experience the discomfort of some of the purely
British establishments. I had made up my mind
on this occasion to try a French hotel. My hands
were filled with cards announcing the merits of
the different inns. The commissionnaires were
deafening me with their shouts, each man bawling
louder than his fellow, when the silk-merchant
declared in a loud voice that there was
nothing like the Hôtel de Luxembourg, and he
added that the <i><span lang="fr_FR">perdrix aux truffes</span></i> and the <i><span lang="fr_FR">vol-au-vent
à la financière</span></i>, as supplied by the chef of
that establishment, were something—yes, something;
and he kissed the tips of his fingers as he
made the last remark, so as to show his appreciation
of the exquisiteness of those dishes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the gentlemen do not wish their
luggage examined?" said an officious Greek, the
commissionnaire of the Luxembourg. "I will
give a baksheesh to the officials in the custom-house,
and they will pass the luggage at once.
But if we do not give them any money," he added,
with a knowing grin, "they will detain you at
least an hour, and rumple all the shirts in your
portmanteaus."
</p>

<p>
"Will it be much money?" inquired my companion,
who, very reluctant to open his purse-strings,
was equally averse to having his shirt-fronts
rumpled.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, leave it to me," replied the Greek, with
an air of great importance.
</p>

<p>
"I know that this scoundrel will rob us!"
ejaculated the silk-merchant. "But we are in
his hands. We must pay, whether we like it
or not."
</p>

<p>
We arrived at the custom-house. An elderly
official approached the Greek, and, pointing to us,
said something in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be robbed, I know we shall,"
muttered my companion excitedly. "If I could
only speak the language, I would just give that
official a piece of my mind."
</p>

<p>
The Greek now put some money into the inspector's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
hand, and the latter, opening and shutting a
hat-case, announced that the examination was
over. Some porters carried our luggage up the
steep hill which led from the port to Pera. We
followed in a rickety old carriage. The springs
were very weak, and the vehicle rolled from side to
side as our horses panted along the wretchedly dirty
street. Presently, to the relief of my companion
and self, who were neither of us feather weights,
the driver pulled up at our destination.
</p>

<p>
In the evening I went to a Turkish Café Chantant.
It was a curious sight. Solemn-looking
Turks were seated round the room, each man
smoking his Nargileh. Little active-looking Greeks
with cigarettes in their mouths, were eagerly
reading the most recent telegrams, and discussing
the chances of peace or war. In the interval between
the songs a small knot of younger Turks
loudly applauded a vocalist, and the latter began
to sing about Sultan Abdul Aziz, of all his glory,
and how at last pride turned his head. He
did foolish things, went mad, and killed himself.
"But it was not his fault," continued the singer,
in another verse, "it was his kismet. If he had
been destined to die a natural death, or on the
battle-field, he would have done so. We are all
under the influence of destiny. Sultans are like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
the rest of the world. Great Sultan, rest in
peace!"
</p>

<p>
I had the good fortune to be accompanied
by a friend, an old resident in Constantinople.
He was a perfect master of Turkish, and he
readily translated to me each verse of the song.
</p>

<p>
"What is your opinion about Abdul Aziz's
death?" I inquired of my companion, as the last
strains of the melody died away. "Did he really
kill himself, as the world would have us believe?
or did some one else save him the trouble?"
</p>

<p>
My companion laughed ironically, paused for a
few moments, and then remarked,—
</p>

<p>
"No one knows the exact facts of the case,
but the popular belief is that he was assassinated.
Indeed, the Turks say that he had agreed to sell
the fleet to Russia, and had consented to allow a
Russian force to garrison Constantinople."
</p>

<p>
"There is no doubt of one thing," continued my
friend, "viz. that the late Sultan was thoroughly
under Ignatieff's thumb. The ambassador could
do what he liked with him. The Softas found it
out, and feared the consequences. From these
facts the public have jumped to the conclusion
that he was assassinated."
</p>

<p>
"But look," added my companion, pointing
to two men in the corner of the room, "there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
are two of the secret police. If they were not
here, we should very likely have had another verse
or so, more explicit as to the Sultan's fate. The
audience would have been delighted if the singer
had given us the popular version of Abdul Aziz's
death."
</p>

<p>
"Are there many secret police?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No, there is, if anything, too much liberty in
Constantinople; the papers write what they like,
and abuse the Government freely, hardly any of
them being suppressed in consequence, whilst
some English newspapers which are more bitter
against Turkey than even the Russian journals, are
sold at every bookstall."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that there is any chance of
another massacre of Christians?" I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Not the slightest; that is to say, if Ignatieff
does not arrange one for some political purpose.
The Turks and Christians get on very well together
here, whatever they may do in other parts of
the country. However, there is one thing which
would be very popular with all classes, and that
is, an English army of occupation in Constantinople."
</p>

<p>
"Why so?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Because this would bring some gold into the
country. We have now nothing but paper. Your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
people would spend money, and business would go
on better. Why, for the last six months trade has
been almost paralyzed. In fact, to tell you the
truth, all classes would be very glad to see the
English at Constantinople. Not for the sake of
your good system of government, as you flatter
yourselves in London, or through fear of being
massacred by Bashi Bazouks, but simply because
you have gold. Unless you bring us some, we
shall all soon be ruined."
</p>

<p>
On the following day I informed the proprietor
of the hotel that I wanted a servant who could
speak Turkish, to accompany me during my journey.
The moment that this became known I
was beset by all sorts of individuals, Armenians
and Greeks, eager to offer their services. Each
man brought his testimonials, and declared that
he was the only honest man in Constantinople,
and that all the other applicants were thieves,
and would certainly rob me. If ever I appeared
to have a predilection for one of the candidates, I
was immediately informed by the others that the
man had been in prison for six months, or else
that he was suspected of murder.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of this I determined to follow
the advice of an Englishman who knew Turkey
well, and take a Mohammedan servant, who could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
speak no other language than his own. In that
case he would be less likely to have learned any
bad habits from the Armenians, and at the same
time I should be compelled to speak to him in
Turkish, and thus improve my knowledge of that
language.
</p>

<p>
The next morning a Turk came to the hotel, and
offered himself for the situation. He was dressed
in the Circassian style, and wore a short brown
serge jacket, dotted across the breast with empty
cartridge cases. His head was covered by a red
fez or cap, encircled by a green turban. A loose
pair of light blue trousers, fastened at the waist
by a crimson sash, and a pair of boots, half-way
up the knee, completed his attire. He was a tall,
fine-looking fellow, and said that he had previously
been coachman to a Pacha, that he was a
good groom, and would be faithful to me as an
Arab steed to his Arab master. It was a pretty
speech, but as I had seen some horses in the
desert which invariably kicked whenever their
master approached them, it did not produce the
effect upon my mind which probably the faithful
man desired. However I was in a hurry to get a
servant; so I agreed to take the fellow, and give
him 4<i>l.</i> per month and his food. In the meantime
he said that he knew of some horses for sale,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
and that he would bring them to the hotel in the
course of a few days.
</p>

<p>
I had previously ascertained that my best plan
would be to purchase a stud in Constantinople.
In many parts of my proposed journey I should
be off the postal track, and then it would be
difficult to hire any horses—indeed it would
sometimes be impossible, as the natives in certain
parts of Kurdistan make use of buffaloes as a
means of locomotion. I had once ridden a cow
during an African journey. The motion is very
uncomfortable; I had no wish to repeat the experiment
with a buffalo.
</p>

<p>
Later on an invitation arrived for me to breakfast
with Mr. Schuyler, the distinguished diplomatist,
and the author of the highly-interesting
volume, "Turkistan." On arriving at his house
I found some of the guests already assembled.
Amongst others, there were Mr. Gallenga, the
<i>Times'</i> correspondent, and Mr. White, our consul
at Belgrade.
</p>

<p>
Presently there was a ring at the bell, and who
should come in but Mr. Sala, the well-known
correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. His
arrival was quite an unexpected pleasure for our
host. Mr. Sala had only reached Constantinople
half an hour before, and had come to us straight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
from the harbour. He had left England about
three weeks previously, and first had gone to St.
Petersburg. Here he had been introduced to
several Russian journalists. He related in a very
amusing way their conversation about England's
policy towards Turkey, an account of which
Mr. Sala had duly posted to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.
</p>

<p>
From St. Petersburg he had made his way to
Odessa, and had come on <i>viâ</i> the Black Sea to
Constantinople. He described all the stations
along the Russian line as crowded with troops
and blocked by military railway carriages; whilst
he laughed incredulously when some of our party
gave it as their opinion that the Conference would
lead to peace.
</p>

<p>
Our host opined that the different representatives
at the Conference would never agree,
and that war would inevitably be the result. He
had recently returned from a visit to Philippopolis,
where he had been staying with Mr.
McGahan, the gentleman who wrote such harrowing
accounts of the massacres in Bulgaria to the
<i>Daily News</i>. Mr. McGahan, it appeared, had
made himself very useful to Lady Strangford in
assisting her to distribute the funds which had
been subscribed for the destitute families in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
East, and was immensely popular with the
Christians.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Turkish newspapers, it was
said, were very divided in their opinions as to the
Conference. The majority of them, however, were
inclined to believe that it was a ruse of Russia
to gain time for her military preparations, and of
England to make Russia unpopular, and to sow
discord between her and the other powers.
</p>

<p>
Later on in the day I met an English officer in
the Engineers, who had come to Constantinople
during his leave, and was spending his time, in
company with some other officers, in surveying a
position between the Sea of Marmora and the
Black Sea, and which is immediately in front of
Constantinople. He was staying at a small
village about twenty miles from Constantinople,
and asked me to spend a day with him and his
friends, when we could ride over the ground
which he was surveying. As I was curious to see
the country in that neighbourhood, I readily
assented to his proposal. It was agreed that I
should leave Constantinople by the seven o'clock
train on the following morning, and that he should
send a horse to meet me at a little station about
twenty miles from the city.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gallenga had been kind enough to give me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
an introduction to some influential Armenians in
Pera. On returning to my hotel I found two of
these gentlemen awaiting my arrival. They were
very disappointed to hear that I had engaged a
Turkish servant, as they said they could have
procured an honest Armenian, and they kindly
volunteered to provide me with letters of recommendation
to the different Armenian dignitaries
in the chief towns which lay in my route.
</p>

<p>
It was easy to gather from the conversation of
one of these gentlemen that he was not well-disposed
to the idea of possibly one day becoming a
Russian subject.
</p>

<p>
"What is your opinion of the wish which General
Ignatieff is said to have expressed, about making
Bulgaria independent of the Porte?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"That would never do," replied one of my
visitors. "We have difficulty enough, as it is, in
keeping our people quiet in Armenia: they will
be very indignant if the Christians in Europe are
granted privileges which the Armenians in Asia
are not permitted to share."
</p>

<p>
"The fact is," observed the other, "that we have
no wish to become Russian subjects. Should this
happen, we know very well what would be the result.
We should not be permitted to use our own language,
and considerable pressure would be brought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
to bear to induce us to change our religion. We
are aware of what has been done to the Catholics
in Poland;<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> we have no wish to be treated in
the same manner."
</p>

<p>
"What we require is similar treatment for all
sects," observed the first speaker, "and that the
word of a Christian when given in a court of law
should be looked upon as evidence, and in the
same light as a Mohammedan's statement. If the
Caimacans (Deputy Governors) and Cadis of the
different towns in the interior were only compelled
to do us justice in this respect, we should
not have much cause to grumble. However, if
the Russians were to go to Van, our fellow-countrymen
would be ten times worse off than
they are at present."
</p>

<p>
Just then an Armenian priest entered the
room. He stooped, and was apparently on
the wrong side of sixty, but he had a quick,
penetrating glance, when he chose to raise his
eyes from the floor, and it was evident that there
was plenty of vigour in his brain, however little
there might be in his body.
</p>

<p>
"This English gentleman wishes to learn some
particulars about the road to Van," observed one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
of the Armenians; "I want you to give him all
the information in your possession."
</p>

<p>
"He will find it very difficult to reach Van at
this season of the year, on account of the snow,
and he will run a considerable risk of being
robbed or murdered by the Kurds," replied
the priest, without raising his eyes from the
ground.
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever been from Scutari to Van?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No, nor hardly any one else. You had better
go by the Black Sea to Trebizond, ride from
there to Erzeroum, and it is only twelve days from
that town to Van; but you would probably find
the road blocked by the snow."
</p>

<p>
It was clear that this priest could not help me
much about my route, so I determined to take
a map, Kiepert's Turkey in Asia, and strike a
line across country as nearly as possible to Erzeroum.
On arriving there I should probably be
able to obtain some information about the state
of the roads.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime the priest and his companions
had left the hotel—not together, but one by one—as
the old man remarked that this would be
less likely to attract attention. Indeed subsequently,
and throughout my journey, I frequently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
remarked the same dread of being seen speaking
to an European on the part of the Armenian
priests. Whether this arises from the fact that
they are afraid of being suspected of conspiring
against the Turkish Government, or it is the
result of a guilty conscience, I cannot say.
</p>

<p>
Armenian newspapers frequently publish news
which cannot be agreeable to the Government,
and they are not interfered with by the authorities.
</p>

<p>
Armenians are not thrown into prison or
banished from the capital without this being at
once published to the world. Then why so much
timidity on the part of the Armenian priests?
If they are not engaged in seeking to undermine
the Government, one would have thought that
they had nothing to fear.

</p>

<p>
I had ordered the porter at my hotel to call me
early on the following morning, as the train
started at seven, and it was quite half an hour's
walk to the station. Luckily I awoke myself,
and on looking at my watch, found it was about
half-past six. Hastily dressing, I hurried downstairs,
and found the individual whose business
it was to awake me, fast asleep under a billiard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
table in the café belonging to the hotel. He
grumbled at being disturbed, and did not fancy
the idea of carrying my box to the station. It
was necessary to use a little persuasive force, so,
seizing a billiard cue, I gave him a violent poke
in the side.
</p>

<p>
"Get up directly! I shall miss the train!"
</p>

<p>
"Please God you will not," replied the Turk,
with a yawn.
</p>

<p>
I had no time to lose, so, taking the recumbent
man by the collar, I lifted him bodily on his legs,
put my bag in his hand, and, with another push
from the billiard cue, precipitated him down the
steps into the street.
</p>

<p>
"You want me to go to the station, Effendi!"
said the fellow, now thoroughly aroused.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But the train will be gone."
</p>

<p>
"Not if we run."
</p>

<p>
"Run!" replied the porter, very much astonished,
"and what will the Effendi do?"
</p>

<p>
"Run too."
</p>

<p>
And with another thrust from the billiard cue, I
started him down Pera.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for me, trains in Turkey are not
very punctual in starting. On arriving at the
railway, about ten minutes past seven, I found that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
I had time to take my ticket to Hadem Kui, a small
station an hour and a half from Constantinople.
There were two Englishmen in the same carriage
as myself, one of them an old friend whose
acquaintance I had made some years previous in
Madrid. They intended to stop at a swamp a
few miles from the city, and spend the day snipe-shooting.
</p>

<p>
Upon my remarking that the railway seemed
to take a very circuitous course, my friend
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "when the line was about to be
constructed, the Government agreed to pay so much
per mile,—the result has been that, although the
country is level, the line is not quite so straight as
it might be."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Turks!" said his companion, "they are
always being abused by the Christians, and yet the
latter make a very good thing out of them. Why,
only the other day, a quantity of Krupp guns were
brought here. The cost price was 150<i>l.</i> per gun,
but the Turks had to pay 750<i>l.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"The Christians are too much for them in a
bargain," he added.
</p>

<p>
My fellow-travellers now left the train, which
had stopped at the side of a wide marsh, and
before our engine was again in motion, the report
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
of a gun made me aware that their sport had
already commenced.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later I arrived at the little station
of Hadem Kui. "Is there a horse waiting for
me?" I inquired. "No," was the answer of
the station-master, a Hungarian. "Can I hire an
animal?" "No," was the reply. "How far is it
to the village where Colonel H—— is living?"
"Seven miles." "What sort of a road?" "No
road at all, but deep mud up to the horse's
girths." "When does the next train go back to
Constantinople?" "Not till seven p.m."
</p>

<p>
I certainly did not bless my friend H——. To
kick my heels about for twelve hours in a station
destitute of a waiting-room, and with nothing to
occupy my time, was not an agreeable prospect.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what you had better do," said the
station-master, "send a boy with a note to your
friend. There is probably some misunderstanding
about the horse, and the boy will be able to get
to the village and back again in a few hours."
</p>

<p>
A lanky, overgrown lad volunteered to take the
letter, and, tucking up his ragged trousers till his
bare thighs were thoroughly exposed to view, he
took off his boots, and started. In a few minutes I
could see him wading through mud at least two
feet deep. A heavy M. F. H. would have found
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
himself considerably out of his element if suddenly
put down with his field and hounds in that line of
country. Imagine layers of the heaviest Bedfordshire
plough-fields all heaped one on the top of the
other, and then you will fall short in attempting
to realize the nature of the soil. If ever an invading
army were to make use of the railway from
Adrianople for an advance upon Constantinople,
and the line between Buyuk Checkmedge on the
Sea of Marmora, and Kara Bournu on the Black
Sea, be selected by the Turks as a last point from
which to defend the capital, the difficulty in transporting
heavy guns and baggage to the centre of
this position would be enormous. The defenders
will have to make a small branch railway in rear
of the line of defence, or it will be impossible for
them to supply their army.
</p>

<p>
The station-master now invited me to sit down
in his room, and wait till an answer to my note
arrived. He was suffering from fever, and complained
of the unhealthy nature of the soil. He
could not sleep at night, and what most worried
him was the incessant click of the telegraph dial.
It was a very busy time, and any number of messages
were always passing.
</p>

<p>
"I can read them as they pass, simply by the
sound," he continued, "and that incessant click,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
click, click, all night, is enough to drive a man
mad. My brain aches. I toss from side to side.
I see devils sitting on the telegraph-box."
</p>

<p>
"Take my word for it, sir," he added, "there
is nothing which breaks a man down so quickly as
being a station-master in Turkey."
</p>

<p>
"What is your salary?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Only 80<i>l.</i> a year. It is not enough to keep
a wife," he added. "If I had a wife the life
would be easier, but there are no women here. I
shall end by hanging myself upon one of my own
telegraph-posts—I know I shall if I stay here
much longer."
</p>

<p>
A letter now arrived from Captain F——, a
friend of H——'s, to say that, in the absence of
the latter, he had opened my letter, and in consequence
had sent me a horse. Such a horse as he
was too, with no shoulders, and only about
thirteen hands high; when I mounted the animal
and had let out the stirrups to their last hole
they were too short. I had the cramp. When I
rode without stirrups my legs were in the mud.
It was a choice of evils—the cramp or the mud,
and the mud gained the day.
</p>

<p>
At last I came to the little village where
Colonel H—— and his friend were residing. An
Armenian servant now informed me that his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
master was busy surveying, but that he would
soon return. The other officer, who had sent me
the horse, was also out, but was shortly expected
home. In about three hours both of them
arrived. H—— had lost his way in the dark.
He had been attacked by a dog; the savage brute
had bitten his boot, and H—— had only saved
himself by using his revolver. He had ordered a
man to bring me a horse, but from the officer not
being able to speak Turkish his instructions had
been misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
The room was not a large one, and only a
few feet square. There was no other, so we
shared it between us, I being accommodated on
the floor. We were up at daybreak, and rode
over the position, a succession of rising slopes,
which looked as if nature had made them especially
for the defence of Constantinople. The
distance from the Sea of Marmora to the Black
Sea is twenty-four or twenty-five miles;<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> but each
flank, being covered by lakes and rivers, could be
easily watched and secured. The extent of the
real fighting-ground would be by these features
reduced to nine or ten miles of plain, but with
favourable undulations affording a good command
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
over the front. Batteries could be so arranged as
to enfilade each other at every point, and should
fifty thousand reliable troops ever make a stand at
this position, it would be a very difficult one to carry.
</p>

<p>
This time my friend had mounted me on a
different sort of animal to the one which I had
ridden on the previous day. He was a stout
grey cob, with good shoulders: when I mounted
him the first thing which he did was to try and
run away. I turned his head towards a neighbouring
height, and let him gallop through the
deep mud. To my astonishment on arriving at
the summit he continued pulling. There was
evidently some good stuff in that horse, and I
determined to buy him. His owner was not in
the village, so I left word that if he would send
the cob to Constantinople, I would give 10<i>l.</i> for the
animal—a very fair price taking into consideration
the market price of horses in the capital.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, after having said good-bye to my
hospitable entertainers, I turned my face towards
the railway-station. A line of telegraph-posts
served me as a guide, and I arrived at the booking-office
in time to catch the train.
</p>

<p>
An acquaintance, a friend of the silk-merchant,
called upon me later in the evening. He proposed
that we should go together to a café, and hear a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
song which a French girl sang every night, and
one in which the Turks delighted.
</p>

<p>
The café, or rather music hall, was a fine
building, crowded with men of all nationalities.
Good-looking Hungarian and Italian girls took
the place of waiters, and bustled about, receiving
orders from the more than usually excited true
believers. Many of the latter, in spite of the
Prophet's injunction, were freely partaking of
raki. Volumes of smoke from the cigarettes
and chibouks of the spectators had created a dense
atmosphere in the building. Some of the attendants
were remarkably handsome girls. Indeed, as
I subsequently learnt, the proprietor of the café
would not engage an ugly woman, his idea being
that the Turks, his chief customers, came quite as
much to look at and talk to his waitresses, as to
see the performance. It must have been a hard
trial for the digestive organs of the better-looking
of these girls. One in particular, a tall and very
handsome Italian, with large dark eyes and an
innocent expression, which probably her character
belied, was in great request, the Turks always
inviting her to share the raki or the coffee which
she brought them. The performance lasted from
eight p.m. till about two in the morning; it was
a wonder that her constitution could stand the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
trial. I called for a cup of coffee, and when she
handed it to me, I asked in Italian what she
would like for herself. The girl's eyes sparkled on
being addressed in her native tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, signore," she said; "I am not a
barrel, although the Turks think I am; but you
are not a Turk. However, I cannot afford to
offend them, for the proprietor pays us no
wages; all I have is what the visitors give
me. It is a dreadful life, signore. Chocolate,
raki, and beer. I only sip, but I have to swallow
a little all the same; then there is lemonade,
coffee, mastic, and occasionally, when gentlemen
like yourself come here—champagne. It is such
a mixture. I have a pain sometimes," she
continued, at the same time pointing to the
bodice of her dress, "I wish to cry, but I have to
run about, smile, wait upon the visitors, and
drink with them—it is a dreadful life. Oh, if
I could only return to Florence!"
</p>

<p>
A Turk seated near me, and who was eagerly
gazing at the girl, made a sign to her.
</p>

<p>
"I must go," she said. "He is a friend of the
proprietor—I dare not offend him."
</p>

<p>
Presently she was sipping some punch from his
glass. My friend caught my eye, and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "she is adding punch to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
other mixtures. Poor child, it will be a wonder if
she does not go off by spontaneous combustion
some day. But, hush! the famous singer is
just going to give us the song about the
Turcos."
</p>

<p>
A tall and rather stout French girl now came
upon the stage. Some long black tresses were
hanging down her back. Her dress, which was
made of white muslin, was very low in front, and
a flaming red sash encircled her waist. The song
had reference to the bravery of the Turcos, how
they died for France, and how France loved
them.
</p>

<p>
The girl had a good voice. As the last notes
died away in the hall, the Turks became greatly
excited. Shouts of applause resounded through
the building. Close to my table were two Englishmen.
One of them appeared to be a correspondent
of some newspaper. His pocket-book
was open on the table. He was taking notes.
"Patriotic song," he remarked to his companion,
"capital scene for a graphic letter—sympathy
between French and Turks—you see she says
France loves the Turks." "Nonsense," said
his companion, "she is singing about the Turcos
in Algeria, not about the Turks—you have
written it all wrong." The Special changed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
colour for a moment, and then muttered, "Confound
it! yes! Algeria is not Turkey, but
it does not much signify." And he went on
writing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>

</p>

<p>
The following morning I was awoke by a tap at
the door, and who should enter my room but the
newly-engaged servant, Osman.
</p>

<p>
"Effendi," he said, "I have five horses for
you to see. They are in a large yard close to the
hotel. Splendid horses they are too. I am so
industrious," he added, "the Effendi will find this
out for himself soon. I am not like other Turks—I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
like working; I have been running all over
Constantinople after the horses, for I heard that
the Effendi was in a hurry to start. When will he
go and see the animals?"
</p>

<p>
About half an hour later I accompanied the
industrious man to a small plot of ground not far
from Pera. It was surrounded by a high wall,
and, judging from the number of loose stones
which lay about, had once been a cemetery. But
cemetery or not it was all the same to Osman, who
had not the same reverence for the dead as the
rest of his countrymen.
</p>

<p>
"There are a great many stones," I observed.
</p>

<p>
"All the better, Effendi," was the reply; "we
shall ride over a number of stones on the road to
Kars, and a little sooner or later for the horses
does not make much difference."
</p>

<p>
The steeds were now led in, accompanied by
their owner, a wall-eyed Turk. They were not
much to look at, if one estimated them from an
English standard, but I had learnt, in previous
travels that one cannot always judge of Eastern
horses by their appearance. I desired my English
servant, Radford, to mount the best-looking one
of the lot, a little black, about fourteen hands
high. He was very thin, and looked as if he
had never been given a good feed of corn, but his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
legs were fine and hard. He put down his feet
flat when he walked, and did not go on his toes,
which last is a fatal defect to a horse if about to
march for many days in succession. Radford eyed
the animal from head to foot.
</p>

<p>
"Lor! sir," he said, "this 'ere horse will never
carry me. He ain't got no shoulders!"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," I replied. "Jump on him and
try."
</p>

<p>
There was no saddle, and my man had to mount
bare back. "Very good," I added, as the animal
appeared to carry his burden without any difficulty,
"take him round at a hard canter."
</p>

<p>
The little brute now began to pull hard, and
bounded over the rough stones in a way that
showed he was well accustomed to such obstacles.
</p>

<p>
"Does he pull?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Pull, sir? He pulls my harms off!"
</p>

<p>
This was enough for me, and I determined to
buy the animal; as a horse that walks well, and
will pull with fourteen stone on his back, is not
a bad one for a long journey.
</p>

<p>
The next one produced for my inspection was
covered with a rug, the other horses not being
provided with any such clothing.
</p>

<p>
"What is that for?" I inquired, pointing at the
cloth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, I put it on him because I was afraid
that he might catch cold," replied the owner.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, take it off. When I buy horses
I like to see them first."
</p>

<p>
"He thinks, sir," remarked my faithful servant,
"that we buy 'orses as they marry their wives—that
is, without looking at them. I should not
be surprised, sir, if that 'ere 'orse had a sore back."
</p>

<p>
The man's remark proved true, and on taking off
the cloth a raw place of at least six inches square
was exposed to view.
</p>

<p>
"He has a sore back," I remarked to the owner.
"Take him away."
</p>

<p>
"Sore back! Yes, he has; it will soon get
well. The Effendi would like this horse though,
and he is a great friend of the horse the Effendi
has just looked at—they eat out of the same
manger. The Effendi had better buy him."
</p>

<p>
"Get on that little bay," I said to my servant,
not paying any attention to the Turk's observation.
As my man went past at a trot, I heard a sound
which at once made me aware that there was something
the matter with the horse's wind.
</p>

<p>
"He is a roarer," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, he makes a noise, but he is stout and
strong. He would make a capital pack-horse."
</p>

<p>
The horse was sound in other particulars, and as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
a roarer for slow marching is as good as any other
animal, I determined to buy him—at the same
time telling the owner that the fact of the horse's
wind not being all right would considerably
deteriorate from his value.
</p>

<p>
"Deteriorate from his value!" said the man,
his wall-eye glaring at me ferociously. "No,
Effendi, he makes a little noise, but that is nothing;
he is a useful horse, and when I let him out on
hire in Constantinople he never runs over the
blind beggars. He gives warning of his approach,
and they hear him coming."
</p>

<p>
I had by this time selected two more horses,
and now came the knotty point of what price I
was to give for the four.
</p>

<p>
"How much do you want for them?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"How much, Effendi? Sixty liras (Turkish
pounds of 18<i>s.</i>) I want, and not a piastre less;
even then I should be a ruined man."
</p>

<p>
"Sixty liras! Sixty dogs and sixty sons of
dogs!" I replied, attempting to address him in
the language easiest understood by a Turkish
peasant.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! Effendi," said the horse-dealer, "you
know the value. To you there is much brain, but
the Effendi's eyes will show him that sixty liras
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
are nothing for the horses—besides, sixty liras,
what are they? Sixty grains from the sand on
the seashore to the gold in the Effendi's purse."
</p>

<p>
I was not going to be bamboozled in that way:
taking forty liras from my pocket, I showed him
the money.
</p>

<p>
"There," I said, "that is all I shall give you,
and all that your horses are worth."
</p>

<p>
"Look! forty liras!" The man attempted to
impart to his countenance an indignant air, but
the sight of the gold was too much for him. "Only
forty liras!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "and if you will not sell them,
I will buy my horses from another dealer," and I
turned to go away.
</p>

<p>
"No, Effendi, do not stir!" cried the owner
hastily. "But <i>forty</i> liras—let us say forty-one—one
lira more—just one—for a baksheesh."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," I said, and I handed him the
money.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, Osman, the Turkish servant, led my
newly-acquired property to a stable which he had
engaged for me in the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
Later on in the afternoon I received a communication
from my friend H——, in which he said
that he had sent the grey horse to Constantinople
by the bearer of the letter, but that the owner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
of the animal would not take less than sixteen
liras for him. As I had thoroughly tried the
animal I determined to accept the offer, and my
stud was now complete.
</p>

<p>
The final preparations for the journey were
soon made. All the horses were fresh shod, and
now I found that a Turkish horseshoe is very
different to the one which we use in this country.
It consists of a thin circular piece of iron, with a
very small hole in the centre, not bigger than a
shilling; almost the entire surface of the hoof
being thus protected by the metal.
</p>

<p>
Two English saddles were bought for myself
and Radford, a Turkish saddle was provided
for Osman, and two pack-saddles for the baggage-horses.
Saddle-bags, corn-sacks, and nose-bags
had been also purchased, and a supply of tea
and such other necessaries as would be difficult
to obtain when once we had quitted the capital.
</p>

<p>
Everything was now ready for the start, so I
hastened to say good-bye to my numerous friends.
Whilst visiting one of them—an English lady—a
Russian acquaintance called upon her, to solicit
subscriptions for a hospital. This building, as it
appeared, was being used for all classes of
patients, and a prince at the Russian Embassy
was at that time occupying one of the wards.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I went to see him yesterday," said the visitor.
He complains dreadfully of the quietness of the
establishment."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps he would like a barrel organ in the
passage," observed my hostess.
</p>

<p>
"That is what I said to him," replied the lady.
"If he had his own way, he would give a ball
there before long."
</p>

<p>
It would rather astonish English people if they
were told that a person holding the position of a
Secretary of Embassy was inhabiting a building
which in this country is reserved for the impecunious,
but no one in Russia thinks anything of
such matters; there are so many princes. Not
many years ago, a prince could have been seen
cleaning the visitors' boots at Dusaux's Hotel in
Moscow.
</p>

<p>
It was Friday, December the 8th, 1876. I
have always been a disbeliever in the sailors'
superstition about leaving a port on a Friday, and
although several of my friends, particularly the
Greek, entreated me to postpone my departure
till the following day, I determined to run the
risk of offending the Fates, and at once to commence
my journey.
</p>

<p>
The street in front of the Hôtel Luxembourg
was filled with a crowd of idlers from an early
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
hour. It had been rumoured about that the
Giaour was mad enough to wish to go to Kars
from Scutari by land, instead of by the Black Sea
and Erzeroum, and that he was about to start.
The Turk had spread the news. His friends and
family had come to see him off. In the meantime,
he himself was busily engaged in loading the
pack-horses, but occasionally found time to
glance superciliously at his admiring and awe-struck
relatives. At last everything was ready;
giving Osman the little travelling sword, I
desired him to strap it round his waist. The
crowd of relations were now more excited than
before. The bystanders took the liveliest interest
in the proceedings. "Osman has got a sword,"
said one. "He is buckling it on," said another.
</p>

<p>
Osman's air of importance increased tenfold
when I desired him to sling my little sporting-rifle
on his shoulder. There was a faint approach
to a cheer from a little boy in the crowd. This
was instantly suppressed, and in the midst of all
the excitement we rode down the streets of
Pera.
</p>

<p>
Several friends of mine were staying at the
Hôtel Royal; as we passed their windows they
invited me to take a stirrup-cup, and in addition
poured out a bumper for the Turk. However,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
Osman could not be induced to drink. He was
more particular in this respect than many of his
fellow-countrymen. He handed the glass to
Radford. The latter was not displeased at the
Turk's religious scruples, as he thus got two
glasses for himself instead of one. He at once
tossed off the contents, and smiling benignantly
returned the tumbler to his companion. I now
shook hands with my friends at the Royal, and
we continued our journey towards the port.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, old fellow," cried my hospitable
entertainers.
</p>

<p>
"We shall meet again soon," was my answer.
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope this side of Hades," said another,
and we rode onward towards Galata.
</p>

<p>
An acquaintance, a Greek gentleman, accompanied
me as far as the port. Here I discovered
that one boat for Scutari had just
started, and that it would be at least three
hours before there would be another. This threw
out my plans. I had wished to march my horses
about five hours that day, but in consequence of
the delay, and the shortness of the evenings at
this season of the year, night would be on us before
we had left Scutari.
</p>

<p>
The steamer arrived. A wide platform was
pushed out from the deck to the shore, and two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
carriages with some horses, belonging to a Turkish
Bey, were taken on board. Then came Radford
and Osman, each leading two horses: I followed
with the little grey. The carriages and
animals belonging to the Bey were placed towards
the bow of the vessel, and the other horses near
the engines.
</p>

<p>
The sea was as calm as a duck-pond. In
Osman's opinion it was unnecessary to tie up our
steeds to the bulwarks. The animals which belonged
to the Bey were simply held by their grooms,
and stood quietly enough by the carriages. Everything
looked <i>couleur de rose</i>, and I went up the
ladder to a sort of raised deck, which arched over
the place reserved for horses, cattle, and other
merchandise. Here several Turkish ladies were
sitting. They were engaged in sipping glasses full
of water. One, who appeared to be the elder of the
party, had some sugar in her pocket; producing
it, she carefully sugared the tumblers of her companions,
and then sugared her own. The faces of
these ladies could be clearly seen through the very
thin muslin texture which served them as veils.
They were not prepossessing, and sadly wanted expression—a
defect which I subsequently observed in
almost every Turkish woman whose countenance I
had the opportunity of seeing. We need not be surprised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
at this. I have been informed by the Turks
themselves that very few women, not one per
1000, can read or write. They amuse themselves
with gossip and eating. Their mental faculties
become absorbed. They live for the moment, and
pine after the coarser and more sensual pleasures.
The domestic life in a Turkish family is often not a
happy one; the elder and less favoured wives hate
to desperation the more attractive and younger
additions to the harem. The middle-aged spouse
is goaded to madness at being deprived of those
favours which the more comely wife is allowed to
share. She endeavours to poison her lord's ear with
respect to the new arrival. The jealous husband
does not know what to believe, his home becomes a
pandemonium.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a loud report, followed by another, and
then another, aroused me from my reflections;
a tremendous noise could be heard below our feet,
and men's voices expostulating in anger.
</p>

<p>
What had happened? One of the Turkish
ladies let her tumbler fall, the faces of the other
passengers became white. Was it a torpedo which
General Ignatieff had set to blow up the Mohammedans,
or had the engine burst?
</p>

<p>
I hurried downstairs. The first thing which
met my gaze was the black horse, "Obadiah"—I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
had named him after a favourite old charger—lying
stretched out on deck, and my English servant
seated on the animal's head. Osman was
holding one end of the grey horse's halter, the
animal amusing himself meanwhile by lashing out
with his heels at the panels of the Bey's carriage.
Fortunately the other horses had remained quiet.
The Bey's servants, instead of attempting to save
the panels of their master's carriage, vented their
wrath by numerous expletives, and were keeping
as far as possible from the scene of action.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll be d—d!"
</p>

<p>
This ejaculation, uttered in a strong Celtic
accent, attracted my attention, as I was busily
engaged holding up the grey's foreleg to keep
him from doing any more damage to the Bey's
vehicle. The forcible exclamation issued from
the lips of an engineer who happened to be
engaged on board the boat.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Happened, sir! The Lord only knows. We
were down below. There was an explosion on
deck. I ran upstairs and saw smoke coming out
of that box. All the horses were topsy-turvy."
</p>

<p>
The box in question contained about 500
loaded cartridges, which I was taking for sporting
purposes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"What does it all mean, Radford?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Lor, sir, it was that black 'orse Obadiah, as was
the bottom of all the mischief. He is that artful.
He stood quiet enough till we started and the
paddles began to turn; he then began to kick,
and frightened the grey. That 'ere Turk," pointing
to Osman, "was a-praying by the side of the
paddle-boxes, and not taking any account of the
hanimals, drat him! Obadiah upset his pack-saddle
and then stamped on the cartridge-box;
some of them have gone off. Hosman left off
praying and began to swear, that's all he did;
and as for them there Turks in charge of the other
'orses, they did nothing. Obadiah slipped up and
I sat on his head to keep him quiet."
</p>

<p>
Luckily no great damage was done except to
the Bey's carriage. We commenced putting the
pack-saddle on Obadiah, but before this operation
was completed our vessel arrived at Scutari. The
steamer would only stop a few minutes at the
port. There was no time to properly arrange
the baggage. The greater part of it had to be
carried out by hand. A crowd of idlers stood on
the shore; some of them, recognizing Osman,
came to help us in adjusting the saddle, each
individual offering advice as to how the baggage
should be strapped to the saddle; Osman meanwhile
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
talking to his friends about the awful
danger which he had incurred, and how, had it
not been for him, the steamer and all the passengers
must inevitably have gone to the bottom.
The Bey's carriage drove past us; the servants on
the box vented their indignation at the damage
done to their master's panels in some strong
language. Osman answered them in a torrent of
expletives, which, translated into Saxon, would
frighten a Billingsgate fishwoman. The bystanders
joined in the chorus, and it was some
time before we were ready to start.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>

<h2>
CHAPTER V.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
Scutari—The resting-place of departed Turks—A frightened
horse—Obadiah—Tea and sugar in the mud—A <i>rahvan</i>, or
ambler—A runaway steed—Osman always praying whenever
there is work to be done—The grave-digger—The
Hammall—Radford—Through the swamp—The Khan at
Moltape—A <i>mungo</i>.
</p>

<p>
The shades of evening were falling fast as we
rode through the town. Presently, leaving behind
the dirty lanes and filthy streets, the main
features of Scutari, we emerged upon the open
country. The road was in a dreadful state, at
least a foot of black mud was piled on the strata
below. In order the better to avoid the dirt we
rode along a raised path which overhung the
highway, Osman and Radford each leading a
baggage-horse. In about half an hour we arrived
at a place where the highway ascended rapidly
for a few hundred yards. The footpath rose yet
more abruptly, and here and there large sections
of it had fallen into the road below. We were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
passing by the cemetery at Scutari. Thousands
of grave-stones which mark the resting-place
of departed Turks lay scattered here and
there. A deep silence reigned around, and the
place appeared a desert, tenanted only by the
dead. Suddenly I heard a noise behind me; a
sound of horse's hoofs striking violently against
some hard substance. I looked round. The first
thing which met my gaze was the horse Obadiah,
the source of all our previous difficulties, with his
pack-saddle under the girth. In the hurry of re-saddling
him at Scutari the yarn breastplate and
crupper had not been well adjusted, nor had they
been properly buckled. The saddle had turned,
and Obadiah was amusing himself by a second
time kicking at my cartridge-boxes, gun-case, and
tins of tea and sugar. Clash went his iron hoof
against one of the cases, away flew the white
sugar into the black mud. A bang resounded
from the gun-case, and that went spinning in
another direction. Fortunately the boxes of
cartridges had rolled to a little distance, and
were just out of reach of the now infuriated
beast's heels. Osman, in a moment of fear had
released the animal's halter; dismounting from
his own steed, he tried to get to Obadiah's head.
This was by no means an easy task; the path
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
was very narrow, in fact there was barely room
enough for a horse to walk. To reach the pack
animal it was necessary to descend to the road,
which lay some feet below us, and then climb up
the steep and muddy bank.
</p>

<p>
Whilst this was being done I took charge of
Osman's horse, the roarer, and which he had
selected for his own riding, because, he said,
the animal was a <i>rahvan</i> or ambler. He had
rubbed his trousers when he made this remark,
and had grinned complacently: by this gesture
he sought to convey to my mind, that his skin
was tender, and that he did not wish to be galled
during the journey.
</p>

<p>
A noise in front now called my attention to
that direction. The horse that Radford was
leading had become alarmed, and in his struggles
to release himself was half-way over the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Let him go!" I cried to my servant, fearing
that he would be dragged over the steep
incline.
</p>

<p>
Down fell the animal on his back, and all the
remainder of my luggage was covered with the
slimy clay. The horse was a little shaken by the
fall and did not attempt to rise—he lay prostrate
and helpless in the midst of the havoc which he
had created. Meantime Obadiah, who had been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
frightened to death by the luggage which was
hanging round his heels, had kicked away his
trammels. Osman approached him from the
bank, and tried to get to his head. It was in
vain. The horse sprang back a yard or so,
plunged and kicked, then slipping like his fellow
steed, he rolled down the steep. He was none
the worse for the fall, and bounding on his legs,
dashed headlong along the road—his saddle
and everything he had previously carried lying
scattered in every direction.
</p>

<p>
The sun by this time had long since set. It
was nearly dark. Letting go Osman's horse, I
galloped after the runaway, but it was useless;
in a moment he disappeared from view. There
was nothing to be done but to return to my
party, and collect the luggage.
</p>

<p>
"Our fate is a bad one," said Osman. "The
horse—curse his mother—has gone, what shall
be done? Praise be to Allah that the Effendi
is not hurt." "I have worked very hard," he
added.
</p>

<p>
"It is all your fault," I remarked angrily.
"It would serve you right if I were to break
your head. You ought to have seen that the
pack-saddle was properly put on the horse at
Scutari."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Saddle, Effendi? It was all owing to the
saddle. It did not fit the horse."
</p>

<p>
"What does he say, sir?" inquired the English
servant.
</p>

<p>
"Say?—confound him! he says it is the fault
of the saddle."
</p>

<p>
"Saddle, sir! no, it ain't. It is all the fault
of his confounded praying. Why, whenever there
is any work to be done, he is always down on his
knees and a-banging his head against the ground.
Real hard work his praying is, sir, and no mistake.
I catched him at it this morning in the
hotel; then he had another turn on board the
steamer—and, look, sir, there he is again. Drat
him, he has taken my coat to kneel on!" And
rushing up, my servant dragged his property
from beneath the prostrate Mohammedan.
</p>

<p>
We were some distance from Scutari, and
about two hours from Moltape, a village in which
I intended to pass the night. I determined to
send Osman back to the town, and desired him
to hire a Hammall, or man with a baggage-horse.
In the meantime, Radford and myself could keep
guard over our luggage.
</p>

<p>
The night grew darker and darker. The
white grave-stones could be barely discerned.
Leaving my English servant to sit upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
luggage in the road, I waded through the mud
to a cleaner spot in the cemetery. Sitting down
on one of the broken monuments, I awaited
Osman's arrival. Presently I heard the sound of
steps close behind me. The locality does not
bear a good reputation, so grasping my revolver,
I prepared for an attack.
</p>

<p>
"Peace be with you!" was the new comer's
salutation, and in a few minutes I discovered that
he was the grave-digger, or person in charge of
the cemetery. His house, or hovel, was not far
off, and he invited me to go there and share his
fire. It would not have been safe to have left the
luggage, so I declined the offer. Soon afterwards
the sound of horses' hoofs in the distance announced
the approach of Osman. He was accompanied
by a Hammall. The latter, placing the
fallen luggage upon his animal, jumped himself
on the top of all.
</p>

<p>
"We had better go back to Scutari, Effendi,"
said Osman. "It is late; there will be no village
for the next three hours. In Scutari there is
good accommodation."
</p>

<p>
I had no wish to turn back. We had already
lost at least half a day through Osman's stupidity;
I resolved to continue the march to Moltape,
and halt there for the night. Osman could start
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
at daybreak for Scutari, and make inquiries about
the lost horse.
</p>

<p>
"Shall you find him?" I inquired of the
Turk.
</p>

<p>
"Find him, Effendi? of course I shall find
him. I will not eat, drink, or sleep till my
lord's property is restored;" by way of substantiating
this statement, Osman took a piece of
bread out of his pocket and began to eat.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I observed, "you said that you were
going to starve till you had found my horse, and
you are eating already."
</p>

<p>
"It is bad for a man with an empty stomach
to be exposed to the night air. I shall be all the
better able to look for the Effendi's horse to-morrow,
and please God I will find him," was the
answer.
</p>

<p>
We continued our journey through the deep
mud, the Hammall riding in front as guide. The
moon rose and threw her pale shadows on the
scene. The Hammall, who was perched up on the
top of a pile of luggage, uttered, from time to
time, shrill cries. Cracks from his whip resounded
from the flanks of his over-taxed steed.
Radford rode pensively in rear; the bowl of a
short wooden pipe glared with the red-hot ashes
of some tobacco. Nothing ever seemed to afflict
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
my English servant. I was going to Kars—well,
he must go too; if I had told him that I was
going up in a fire balloon, he would have been
equally ready to accompany me. I wish we had
four hundred thousand men like him in the
British army. The soldier who will ask no questions,
will go where you like, and die in his
place if you tell him to do so, is preferable,
in my mind, to the more educated individual
who reflects, weighs probabilities, and sometimes
runs away.
</p>

<p>
Now a light appeared in the distance, and then
another. The swamp through which we had
been riding was gradually replaced by harder soil.
A few whitewashed cottages were met with at
intervals along our path. Presently we rounded
a corner, and a large village was exposed to view.
The Hammall rode up to a house which was
detached from the rest, and in the centre of the
town. He leaped from his horse, and, coming to
my side, held the stirrup-leather for me to dismount.
We had arrived at a Khan, or resting-place
for travellers. On lifting up the latch,
or rather pulling at a piece of string which was
used as a substitute for a handle, the door
opened.
</p>

<p>
I found myself in a large, low room. So soon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
as my eyes became accustomed to the dense atmosphere,
I discovered that almost all the available
space was filled with soldiery. On one side of the
room there were a succession of broad wooden
shelves, ascending towards the roof, these too
were tenanted. It was difficult to put a foot down
upon the floor without treading upon the face
or body of some follower of the Prophet. The
smell which arose from so much humanity was
anything but agreeable. A <i>mungo</i>, or circular
iron pan on a tripod, was filled with burning
charcoal, and placed on a stool so as to be removed
from the immediate vicinity of the sleepers.
It gave out a blue and sulphurous flame. The
charcoal had not been properly burned through
previous to being placed in the <i>mungo</i>. It added
some poisonous fumes to the unhealthy atmosphere.

</p>

<p>
The proprietor of the establishment, a Greek,
slowly raised himself from a recumbent position.
His head was bound up in what appeared to be a
red stocking; the toe part of this article of attire
hung carelessly over his left shoulder. He was a
dirty-looking little fellow, and had a large wen
on one side of his forehead. Nature had determined
to make him as hideous as possible, and
some fellow-mortal had added to her handiwork,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
for a large scar, barely cicatrized, and apparently
inflicted by a knife, extended right across his face.
This scar and the wen were, in the daytime, a perpetual
resort for blue-bottle flies. These insects,
I subsequently observed, had a great affection for
the frontispiece of the proprietor.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" he asked in <i>lingua
franca</i>, that undefined mixture of Italian, French,
Greek, and Spanish, which is spoken throughout
the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
"I want a place to sleep in."
</p>

<p>
"Place to sleep in? Sleep here," and he
slowly subsided into his original position.
</p>

<p>
Osman now began to address him, and in a
whining tone said that I was his Effendi, a great
person with gold, not paper, in my pocket, and that
I would pay liberally for accommodation. The allusion
to the gold acted like a charm upon the Greek.
</p>

<p>
"Gold!" he said. "Gold! Let me see it!"
</p>

<p>
I took out a lira (Turkish pound), and spinning
it carelessly in the air, let it fall on an earthenware
dish. The coin gave out a metallic ring.
The Greek clutched at the fallen lira; but the
nimble Osman was too quick for him, and picking
it up returned it to me.
</p>

<p>
"I have no rooms but this," said the proprietor
eagerly; "but I have a stable. Why not sleep in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
the stable? You want a stable for your horses, and
I will put down some clean straw for the Effendi."
</p>

<p>
Our horses were all this time tied up to a post
outside. I was on the point of accepting his
offer, so as to gain shelter for them as well as for
ourselves, when the door opened. A strange
figure loomed in sight.
</p>

<p>
"The Onbashee (corporal)," said the proprietor
in a cringing tone, springing to his feet; and
seizing several soldiers who were asleep on a
bench, he rolled them on to the floor, thus making
room for the new arrival. The latter, a dumpy-looking
man, with a fez on his head, red
regimental trousers, and a short yellow dressing-gown,
sat down on the bench, and beckoned to
me to sit by his side. The occupants of the room
by this time were thoroughly aroused. A small
boy, the exact counterpart of the proprietor minus
the scar and wen, speedily made some coffee.
The fragrant beverage was duly handed first to
the Onbashee and myself, and then to Osman and
Radford, the head of the latter being in close
proximity to the ceiling of the establishment.
</p>

<p>
I addressed the corporal, and told him that
I was an English traveller, who wanted a night's
lodging.
</p>

<p>
"English!" he cried, then springing to his feet
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
he respectfully saluted, and said, "I thought,
Effendi, that you were an Italian or a countryman
of the Greek here," pointing to the proprietor of
the place. "Come along, sir," leaving the building,
he led me to a small building, apparently
a guard-house, for in the room below there were
ten soldiers, some rifles and accoutrements being
suspended on a rack on the wall. Ascending
a few rickety stairs, I entered a small lobby. It
was about ten feet square, and had no furniture
save a wooden ledge.
</p>

<p>
"This is my room," said the Onbashee. "You
and the other Englishman can sleep here. I will
sleep downstairs with the men." Then bringing
two blankets he threw them down on the ledge,
saluted in a military fashion, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"Queer place, sir," said Radford, looking round.
"However, it is better than the hole downstairs.
Shall I sleep here, sir, or in the stable?"
</p>

<p>
"On the floor," I replied. "Go and look
after the horses, and then bring up some
rugs."
</p>

<p>
At daybreak Osman started for Scutari in
search of the lost horse. A few hours later I
took my gun, and went to see if I could find any
snipe in a marsh near the town. About six p.m.
Osman returned. It was easy to see from his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
crestfallen face that he had heard no news of the
lost Obadiah.
</p>

<p>
"<i>At Gitdi!</i> The horse has gone, Effendi," he
said. "I have been to every farm-house near
here, and no one has seen a black gelding with
his tail cut short. Praise be to Allah that I cut
all the horses' tails before starting; our animal
will be different from the others in the neighbourhood,
and will be easily distinguished."
</p>

<p>
"I went to the Pacha at Scutari," he added,
"he has given orders to the police to search
for the horse. When he is found, he will be sent
after the Effendi by train to Ismid."
</p>

<p>
<i>Gitdi</i> (it has gone), I began to hate that word.
Later on, if our tea had been stolen, Osman invariably
greeted me with <i>gitdi</i>. It is the first word which
a traveller in Turkey hears, he is kept in mind
of it during his entire journey. There was nothing
to be done but to hire another baggage-horse, and
give orders for a start at daybreak.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes before leaving Moltape, I went to
the corporal, and put in his hand a dollar (medjidi),
in return for the accommodation he had given me.
There were several soldiers present. He declined
the present with a grandiose air, adding that his
home was mine, and that all strangers were
welcome to the abode. However, a few minutes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
later, when I was alone, he approached, and putting
out his hand, said, "Effendi, no one is looking,
I will accept a present." Human nature in
all countries is much the same. The corporal's
demeanour before the soldiers much resembled
that of a railway porter when offered a tip in the
presence of a railway director.
</p>

<p>
We rode through a beautiful country. Our
track lay across a plain. It was surrounded
by undulating hills. Pretty villas with Venetian
windows decked their crests. Vines, fig, and other
fruit trees studded the rising slopes. A few hours
later the path became very bad. We made our
way across deep, half hidden ruts, which compelled
us to advance with the greatest care for fear of
breaking the horses' legs.
</p>

<p>
We ascend a steep incline, and then, far away
in the distance, and across the bay of Ismid, are
cone-shaped hills covered with fleecy snow.
</p>

<p>
The path turned, we rode along the seashore.
The railway ran along the side of the track, now
ascending in tortuous coils, now disappearing
altogether from our view, to appear once more in
the distance, and almost level with the azure
deep. Not a ripple disturbed the surface of the
waters; coloured rocks and stones met our gaze
as we glanced into the abyss below; festoons
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
of variegated sea-weed hung from the rugged
cliffs.
</p>

<p>
The sun's rays were fierce and scorching. In
spite of its being the month of December, there
was a glare as if on a July day. I was not sorry
when, on reaching the crest of an adjacent hill,
Osman dismounted, and suggested a halt for lunch.
</p>

<p>
"A capital spot, Effendi," he remarked, "there
is a spring of fresh water, a cave, and firewood.
I have a beautiful goose, plump as a Georgian
woman, in the saddle-bags. My brother," pointing
to Radford, "shall cook him. Our stomachs
grieve now, but soon they shall be comforted."
</p>

<p>
He led the way to a sort of cavity in the rock.
A fire was kindled, and the goose, the subject of
Osman's admiration, was shortly simmering on the
embers.
</p>

<p>
Presently the track became worse, if possible,
than before. Several wooden bridges over deep
and narrow gullies had to be crossed. There were
no parapets to the bridges. Here and there
holes a foot square let us see the stream below.
Then we traversed lanes of water, in some places
up to the horses' girths. The Hammall went
first, and wended his way with caution. Two
ditches skirted the borders of the track; the rain
had fallen heavily, and had one of our horses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
made a mistake or floundered, his rider would have
found himself in at least six feet of water.
</p>

<p>
We were nearing Ismid, the Nicomedia of
ancient history. Our tired animals seemed aware
of its proximity; they quickened their pace. Very
shortly afterwards we rode into the town. I had
sent forward a messenger to tell the chief of the
police that an English traveller was coming to
Ismid, and to ask him to provide me with lodgings
for the night, there being no hotels in the place.
</p>

<p>
I was met at the entrance of the town by a
Zaptieh, or gendarme. Going before us, he led
the way to a house kept by a Greek. Here I
found two clean rooms furnished in the European
fashion. The Zaptieh, after inquiring if I had
any orders to give him, left the room, saying that
he would report my safe arrival to the Pacha.
</p>

<p>
On the morrow I received a visit from the chief of
the Telegraph department in Ismid—an Armenian
who spoke French. On showing him a letter of
introduction which I had received at Constantinople,
for the Christian dignitaries in Ismid, he at
once became very communicative, and hastened to
relate a grievance which, according to him, an
Armenian had lately suffered owing to Turkish
misrule. It appeared that this man had borrowed
money from a Turk, and had given his wife's earrings
and necklace as security for the debt. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
arrangements for the loan had been made in the
presence of my informant. "But now," he continued,
"comes the pith of the story. The Turk
died. The Armenian, paying the debt to the
dead man's heirs, asked for his wife's necklace
and earrings. The Turk's family would not give
them up. The Armenian appealed to the Cadi.
The Cadi would not do justice, because it was the
word of a Christian against the testimony of a
Turk; and in such instances an Armenian's evidence
goes for nothing. However," added the
speaker, "I telegraphed to the authorities in
Constantinople. An order at once came for justice
to be done."
</p>

<p>
Later on I walked through the town. It is
built in the form of a half-moon, and is erected on
the heights around the shore. Tiers and tiers of
houses are perched up in out-of-the-way corners.
Here a solitary one stands aloof like an eagle's
nest and far above its fellows. No order has
been followed in the construction of these houses.
Every sort of shape and pattern is to be seen.
Many of them are like Swiss chalets. Their
wooden walls are bright with an infinite variety of
hues.
</p>

<p>
It was, apparently, a washing-day. The nether
garments and shirts of Turks and Christians
were suspended from every window-sill. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
apparel was of all the colours in the rainbow, and
lit up the scene still more. There were a few
well-built stone buildings—amongst them the
palace of the Pacha. I called upon this official in
the afternoon, and found him a tall, fine-looking
man, considerably over six feet in height. He was
seated in European fashion upon a sofa, and not
squatted on the floor like some others of his countrymen
who were present at the time of my visit.
He spoke French fluently, and also Russian,
having spent some years in the Turkish Consulate
in Odessa; his residence there had not inspired
him with any affection for the subjects of the
Tzar, whom he cordially detested.
</p>

<p>
"Your minister, Mr. Gladstone, hates us poor
Turks quite as much as the Russians do," presently
remarked the Pacha.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Gladstone is not a minister," I remarked,
"he is not by any means omnipotent in England.
A great many of my countrymen have
already evinced their sympathy for your nation."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the Pacha, "that is true, they
have sent medicines to our wounded soldiery.
Gladstone is what you call a Liberal, is he not?"
</p>

<p>
"He is one of the leaders of the Liberal Party,
and was its chief till he was turned out by the
actual Government."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Ah! I remember," said the Pacha. "He
told the people of England that they must not
drink after certain hours, and quarrelled with
your priests. I read all about it in the newspapers.
It struck me as strange conduct in a
man who calls himself a 'Liberal.' Has he many
friends in Parliament?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but not so many as formerly; his conduct
about this Eastern question has drawn away
some of his most influential supporters."
</p>

<p>
"Well, at all events if there is war, please God
we shall be allies."
</p>

<p>
"Please God we shall," I replied devoutly.
</p>

<p>
"You know," he continued, "that we are much
stronger than people in Europe believe. We can
put an army of 700,000 men into the field."
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to Allah!" interrupted an elderly
Turk who was squatted on the carpet, at the same
time gravely stroking his white beard.
</p>

<p>
"Why is it that the people in England hate us
so much?" inquired the Pacha.
</p>

<p>
"Partly on account of the excesses of your
irregular soldiers in Bulgaria; but mainly because
you repudiated your debt. How should you like
to have lent money and then to receive no
interest?"
</p>

<p>
The Pacha laughed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are right. It was a great mistake.
But that is all Russia's fault. Her agents
brought about the revolution in the Herzegovina.
Her functionaries encouraged Sultan Abdul Aziz
in his extravagance, and were the main cause of
the debt being repudiated. They thought that
this would make us unpopular with England, and
they were very right in their conjectures. There
is plenty of wealth in Turkey," he continued. "If
it were not for the impending war, we could pay
some part of our interest now; but Russia will not
let us be quiet. She compels us to keep up a
large army. Her agents bring about massacres of
Christians, and set the whole world against us."<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
</p>

<p>
"If there is a war, I hope that we shall cut the
throats of all the Russians," interrupted the old
gentleman on the carpet.
</p>

<p>
"Allah grant that we may!" exclaimed the rest
of the assembly.
</p>

<p>
Coffee and pipes were now handed round, and
my interview came to an end. The Pacha having
kindly given orders for a telegram to be sent to
Scutari, to inquire if anything had been heard of
my runaway horse.

</p>

<p>
In the evening I called upon an Armenian Bishop.
He lived in a quaint old-fashioned house in
the Christian quarter of the town, the Turks
and Armenians inhabiting different districts in
Ismid, as in many other Turkish cities. Refreshments
were now brought in on a silver tray, and
several kinds of jam handed round in little silver
dishes. The guest taking a spoonful of jam is
expected to swallow it, he then drinks a glass of
water. This is an economical refreshment, a very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
little jam goes a long way in the entertainment.
</p>

<p>
"How do you like it?" said one of the party.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," I replied, at the same time
having that sort of feeling in my mouth which
carried my memory back to boyish days, and to the
grey powders which my old nurse used to administer,
"very good."
</p>

<p>
"We always treat our guests in this manner,"
said an old Armenian pompously. "It is the
custom of our nation."
</p>

<p>
Now the conversation turned upon the Turks in
Ismid, and it was pleasant to hear that some of
the Turkish officials were well spoken of, even by
the Armenians.
</p>

<p>
"The chief of the police here is a capital
fellow," observed one of the company. "During
the Ramazan, one of our people was smoking in
the streets, a Mohammedan went up to him and
struck him with a stick. The chief of the police,
who happened to be passing by, saw this. He
approached and said, 'Why did you strike that
man?' 'Because he was smoking during
Ramazan.' 'Did he put his cigarette in your
eye?' 'No,' 'Then you had no business to
strike him. You shall go to prison and learn to
behave better for the future?'"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said another of the guests; "the
Turkish papers published the story, and highly
praised the conduct of the official."
</p>

<p>
"The Turkish Government is not so bad,"
observed a third gentleman. "It wishes justice
to be carried out impartially throughout the
empire, but, so long as the Cadis refuse to take
the word of a Christian as evidence, it will be
difficult for us to live with any degree of comfort."
</p>

<p>
"After all," he continued, "this is an abuse
which has crept in amidst the Turkish officers.
The Koran says that the testimony of a Christian
witness is to be taken as evidence, but nowadays
many of the Mohammedans have forgotten the
Koran."
</p>

<p>
In the evening a telegram arrived from the
Pacha at Scutari. It was to the effect that nothing
had been heard of my horse; however, so soon as
the animal was found he should be sent after me.
This would have been useless. There was no rail
beyond Ismid, and I intended to start the following
morning. In consequence of this, I wrote to
a friend at the British Embassy, to ask him, in
the event of the horse being found, to have the
animal sold at the market in Constantinople.
Meantime I sent Osman to hire a post-horse to
carry my baggage as far as Sabanja, a small
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
village about twenty miles from Ismid, and on the
road to Angora. Just as we were leaving Ismid,
two Zaptieh or mounted police rode up. They
had been ordered by the Pacha to escort me as
far as Sabanja. Smart-looking fellows they were,
too, with light blue jackets, red trousers, and
Hessian boots. Each of them carried a repeating-rifle
slung across his shoulder. Revolvers were
stuck in the crimson sashes which encircled their
waists. Short scimitars, but with no hilt-guards
to protect the hand, were slung from their sword-belts.
</p>

<p>
It is singular that the Turkish military authorities,
who have adopted the modern armament in
so far as fire-arms are concerned, should be still so
backward in the manufacture of swords. A cavalry
soldier armed with a Turkish sword without a hilt-guard
would have very little chance if engaged
in a hand-to-hand encounter with a dragoon
supplied with one of our own weapons.
</p>

<p>
After riding for about half an hour in the
direction of Sabanja, Radford—who was leading
a pack-horse, remarked to Osman,—
</p>

<p>
"What have you done with the post-horse?"
</p>

<p>
The Turk did not understand the question.
When it was interpreted to him, he replied,—
</p>

<p>
"The animal is in front with the Zaptieh."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As it is always as well to put a Turk's statement
to the test, I determined to trot on ahead
and look for myself. The Zaptieh had not seen
the horse. It appeared that after loading him,
Osman had started the animal, much in the same
way as an Irishman does a pig, with the object
of driving him before our party. We now all
dispersed in different directions, and finally, after
a two hours' search, discovered the animal tied
up by the side of a Khan, an old woman who
had observed the horse wandering about having
attached him to a post.
</p>

<p>
The track now became much worse than anything
I had previously seen. In many places
there were quite four feet of mud. It reached
our horses' girths, and with the greatest difficulty
we were able to force a passage.
</p>

<p>
Presently we came to a hollow in the path.
Here a cart drawn by four oxen was at a standstill.
The bullocks, with only their necks and shoulders
out of the mud, gazed plaintively before them.
The two drivers had taken off their trousers and
under-clothes; their shirts were tucked up to their
armpits; they waded through the black slime,
and goaded the bullocks forward.
</p>

<p>
A creaking noise was heard from the ponderous
wheels. The four bullocks put forth all their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
strength; it was a useless effort, one of them
pulled the cart a little to one side, the next
instant it was upset and half buried in the mire.
The two men with naught on them save little red
fez caps and with their tucked-up shirts, presented
a doleful picture. They were not burdened
with much flesh, and ribs and shoulder
bones were prominently thrown into relief by the
coating of mud which reached as high as their
waists. One poor fellow, wading up to us, asked
Osman to give him a light for his pipe. The
other one, looking more woe-begotten, if possible,
than his fellow, had no pipe, and mournfully asked
for a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Effendi," said Osman, "this is a dreadful
place. We may be upset. Our horses will not
get through. Better go back to Ismid and wait
there till the mud becomes hard."
</p>

<p>
"No; go on. Horses can march where
bullocks cannot."
</p>

<p>
Osman turned white, he was riding a little in
advance of me, and did not at all like being sent
forward to experiment upon the depth of the mire.
</p>

<p>
"He is a poor creature," observed Radford,
contemptuously, "Lor, sir, what else can we
expect of them? They don't drink no beer. They
turn hup their noses at wine. Hosman's blood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
ain't no thicker than ditch-water—I will lay a
pound it ain't."
</p>

<p>
Our saddle-bags were covered with mud when
we gained a footing on the other side. Osman,
riding up to my side, congratulated himself on
having guided us through in safety.
</p>

<p>
"Your face was very white," I observed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Effendi, my blood had turned to milk.
It was not for myself, it was for the Effendi.
I thought that he might be suffocated. Osman is
yours, you can do with him what you like."
</p>

<p>
All these were very pretty speeches; however,
I had been sufficiently often in the East to know
how to appreciate them at their true value. I felt
tolerably certain that if Osman's courage was
ever put to the test, he would be found to value
his existence in this world more than the society
of a million beautiful wives in the world to come.
</p>

<p>
After all, he would have been no exception to
mankind in general. I remember during the last
Carlist war hearing a story about a priest who,
on the eve of an expected battle, addressed the
soldiers in his battalion, and informed them that
whoever was slain in the morrow's fight should
sup with Nuestro Señor in Paradise. The
morrow came, the battle raged, and the Carlists
were beaten—the priest's battalion being the first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
to run away, headed by the divine himself, who,
tucking up his cassock, ran as fast as his legs
could carry him. A soldier touched the reverend
gentleman on the shoulder, and said, "You
told us, my father, that whoever was slain in
to-day's fight should sup in Paradise, but you are
running away." "My son," replied the Cura, who
was very much out of breath, "I, I—never sup—I
suffer from a weak digestion—I only dine."
Some people in England believe that a doctrine of
predestination makes the Turkish soldiers indifferent
to death. This may be true in a few
isolated instances; but, as a rule, both Turks and
Christians have an extreme dislike to the dread
ordeal.
</p>

<p>
The track became firmer. We overtook some
Bashi Bazouks returning from Bulgaria. They
were most of them Circassians, and one could
speak Russian. He was very indignant at having
been ordered home, and brandishing his long
lance, with bright steel point at least twelve
inches long, regretted that he had lost the
opportunity of transfixing a few giaour Russians.
</p>

<p>
"Did you kill many women?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"There were some killed," he replied. "It
was a pity. We were sorry for it; but what
would you have our men do? Some of their own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
mothers and sisters had been ravished and then
butchered by the Russians."
</p>

<p>
"Have any of your relatives been treated in
this way?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "but in a village not far from
Gumri, some horrible cruelties have recently
taken place, many women and children were
slain, and all because they wished to leave Russia
and go to Turkey."
</p>

<p>
"If my mother or sister had been killed, I
should not be particular as to how I avenged her,"
he continued. "These cowardly Russians set us
the example."
</p>

<p>
There was no sort of similarity in the attire of
the Bashi Bazouks. Each man had dressed himself
according to his fancy; the broad sashes
around their waists were stuck full of pistols and
daggers. The fire-arms, too, were of the most
primitive kind; some men had old-fashioned muskets
of the Tower pattern, and others were armed
with double-barrelled guns, which had been converted
from flint to percussion. Their horses
looked hard and fit for work, they were as a rule
not more than fourteen hands high, and their
rough shaggy coats reminded me a little of
the Cossack horses which I have seen in the
neighbourhood of the Don.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The scenery improves as we approach Sabanja.
The flat country previously traversed
gives way to rising mountains. They bound our
view towards the West. On my bridle-hand is a
wide lake. It lies like a mirror almost at our
feet. Many coloured grasses and shrubs clothe
the slopes which lead down to the limpid water.
Acres upon acres of rich grass-land—such as
would make the mouth of a Leicestershire farmer
water with envy—surround Sabanja on every side.
We ride into the village; it consists of about
200 houses, mostly built of dried mud, and
with much difficulty I obtain accommodation for
the night.
</p>

<p>
Long before daybreak we were in the saddle.
Our road wound through mountain passes. Huge
clouds of mist slowly rose from the surface of the
lake: they floated away into space, and appeared
like icebergs as seen in the horizon. Now we rode
by a place where preparations had been made for
the construction of a railway. Sleepers were
lying by the side of a partly-made embankment.
On inquiry, no work had been going on for
two years. There was to have been a railway to
Angora, but "Para yoke, there is no money,"
was the answer to my questions on the subject.
</p>

<p>
Presently we came up to a caravan of mules
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
laden with tea and bound for Angora. The
road was very narrow, there was barely room for
two horses abreast. One mule, turning his head
towards the bank, blocked up the entire path; a
blow from our Zaptieh's whip recalled him to consciousness.
Backing a few yards he slipped, and
rolled with his burden down the slope. The
owner cursed, and the other muleteers coming up
seemed rather to enjoy his discomforture.

</p>

<p>
The road became more level. We encountered
caravans of camels, the animals not being
led by a cord attached to a peg through the
nose, but by a halter loosely fastened round the
neck.
</p>

<p>
They were fine beasts and covered with shaggy
hair. This, I was informed, is cut off them at
certain seasons in the year, and is then converted
into a material for tents and rugs. Each caravan
was headed by a man riding a donkey, the pace of
the latter being if anything a little superior to
that of the huge camels behind them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We continued along the left bank of the river
Sakaria, a rapid stream, sixty yards wide and with
steep banks; presently we crossed it on a stone
bridge, very much out of repair. The centre part
had fallen away. This had been replaced by wooden
beams covered with loose earth. Presently we
came to a large valley abounding with corn, vines,
and mulberry-trees, and I halted for the night in
the village of Geiweh. The Mudir, a sort of local
mayor, came out to meet us, and insisted that I
should be his guest. He was a very communicative
man, and informed me that Yakoob Khan
was about to bring an army of 50,000 men to
assist the Sultan.
</p>

<p>
"How will he come?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"By the sea," remarked my host, his geographical
knowledge about Kashgar not being very
extensive. He next informed me that Persia was
supposed to be very friendly towards Russia, and
that the Turks hated the Persians, but liked the
Christians, with the exception of the Greeks,
whom they believed to be in league with the
Tzar.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after leaving Geiweh, the valley takes a
circular form, and is at least three miles in
diameter; hills with slopes well adapted for
artillery fire surround it on every side. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
little stream Kara Su, which is only knee deep,
traverses the district, and finds its way a few miles
further down into the Sakaria. The Geiweh valley
would be a magnificent position into which to entice
a careless general. The exit towards the east is
by a steep ravine with precipitous banks, and on
the west it is blocked by the Sakaria.
</p>

<p>
We now reached Terekli, a small town with
about 800 houses. Every house was full of soldiers,
who were <i>en route</i> to the capital. The sun
was descending over the mountain tops as we
rode through the narrow streets. Hundreds of
Bashi Bazouks were performing wild evolutions in
the plain below; some men were firing at a target
from horseback at a gallop, others whirling their
rifles about to the imminent danger of the bystanders.
The many coloured dresses of this
guerilla soldiery and of the lookers-on, lit up the
surroundings of the landscape. The wild shouts
of the horsemen re-echoed over the mountains.
From the distant peaks the bleating of the goats
could be faintly heard, as the shepherds were driving
them home for shelter. This sound was
mingled with the lowing of cattle and the rippling
of the stream below. It was a romantic picture.
It vividly recalled to my mind some scenes
in the Basque provinces during the late Carlist war.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The soldiers started at four the following morning,
singing in chorus as they marched through
the streets. An hour later we continued our
journey through a mountainous district strewed
with blocks of granite, and soon afterwards crossed
the little river Goonook, another tributary of the
Sakaria.<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> Here the scenery is very wild; the hills
are of all shapes and forms, as if cast down at
haphazard by the Titans of old. Now we find a
series of natural bastions and ramparts, looking
as if they had been chiselled out of the hard white
rocks, and then approach a slate mountain, large
black stones lying about in endless profusion.
Presently we ride along a path bounded on
both sides by a precipice. Our track twines like
a silver thread amidst the crags which hide the
way before us.
</p>

<p>
We round a corner. A small village is seen
below, Torbali is reached, and a Bey, the great
man of the place, invites us to share his dwelling.
</p>

<p>
A little later, a black slave brought me as a
present from his master, some small trout and
fresh eggs. The slave could talk Arabic. He
had been born near Gondokoro, and had been
kidnapped from that part of the world by a party
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
of Arabs under Sir Samuel Baker's <i>bête noir</i>, Abou
Saood. I asked him if he would like to return to
his own country.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he said, "if the Effendi is going there with
Abou Saood. We could then catch plenty of slaves."
</p>

<p>
"I know where to find them," he added, "we
should soon become rich."
</p>

<p>
There is an old proverb, "Set a thief to catch a
thief," but here it seemed equally applicable to
slaves. I was struck by the extreme eagerness to
kidnap his countrymen which was evinced by this
negro gentleman.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said, "how are you treated by your
master?"
</p>

<p>
"He is a good man," was the reply, "there is
plenty to eat, and not much to do."
</p>

<p>
"One thing is bad here," he added, "the master
does not drink <i>sharab</i> (wine). I like <i>sharab</i>—lots
of <i>sharab</i>, it makes one gay. Will the Effendi
give me a little <i>sharab</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not any. I do not drink myself."
</p>

<p>
"And yet you are rich," said the slave. "You
have money to buy it, happy man that you are.
If I were like you I would drink, drink, drink,
all day and all night!"
</p>

<p>
"But Osman does not drink, he attends to the
Prophet's laws."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Osman is a horse; he does not know what is
good," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
At this moment the voice of the Bey was heard.
"<i>Gell!</i>" (come) resounded through the building;
the negro, leaving me, hurried off to his master.
</p>

<p>
It was a nine hours' march to Mudurlu, our
next halting-place, the route leading through a
very mountainous district. The village, or small
town, of Mudurlu contains 800 mud houses, which,
at the average rate of five people to a family,
would give about 4000 inhabitants. The traveller,
when journeying in this part of Anatolia, is much
struck by the absence of shops. He may pass
through village after village, small town after
small town, and, unless it be market day, he will
be unable to purchase anything.
</p>

<p>
"Can I buy some meat?" I would inquire of
Osman.
</p>

<p>
"We will see, Effendi. I will run to the Khan,
and inquire of the people there."
</p>

<p>
This was Osman's favourite amusement. Under
the pretence of making purchases, he would go to
the different Khans, talk for some time to the
assembled villagers about his own merits, drink
several cups of coffee, and return.
</p>

<p>
"Well, where is the meat?"
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, there is no meat."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Have you been to look?"
</p>

<p>
"Look, Effendi! My clothes are moist with
perspiration. But there are some chickens; they
will do for our dinner."
</p>

<p>
This was the daily food—chicken. It is not a
bad diet if a man is living a sedentary life, and not
taking much exercise, but after a nine hours' ride
he requires something a little more nourishing.
<i><span lang="fr_FR">Toujours perdrix</span></i> was too much for a French cardinal;
if the holy gentleman had been riding
through Turkey, he would have found <i><span lang="fr_FR">toujours
poulet</span></i> an equally unsubstantial diet. A crowd
assembled to see us depart. The people in
Mudurlu taking as much interest in an Englishman
as the inhabitants of London would take in
a chimpanzee or newly arrived gorilla. Asiatics
have a very high opinion of our skill as manufacturers.
English goods, can be met with in
almost every large town in Anatolia, and the Turks
prefer English merchandise to the cheaper but
inferior articles sent from Belgium or America.
</p>

<p>
The Zaptieh who went with me was a magnificent-looking
fellow. Picture to yourself a tall,
dark Circassian, with large piercing eyes, and
carefully trimmed beard—a striking contrast to
the huge white turban which surrounded his fez.
He was dressed in a green jacket with red facings;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
a blue waistcoat peered from beneath it, and a
pair of green trousers and red leather boots
covered his extremities. He was armed with a
sword and revolver, and, when the road permitted,
was continually exercising his horse. Now
he would break into a gallop, go at headlong
speed for fifty yards, then, pulling his steed almost
on his haunches, he would start in another direction,
and, bending from the saddle-bow, touch the
ground. All this was done with the most consummate
grace and ease—in fact, as if horse and
rider were one.
</p>

<p>
Soon we left behind us the light sandy
soil which admitted of such-like evolutions.
A chain of steep heights had to be passed. The
mud became at each moment deeper. The
baggage animals had great difficulty in ascending
with their loads. We were struggling up an
almost perpendicular height. At our feet and
at least forty yards below yawned a deep abyss.
The path itself was in no place more than ten
feet wide. The sound of an oath issuing from
Osman's lips attracted my attention. One baggage-horse
lay on the ground; he was kicking
violently, and his head and shoulders were over
the precipice. Osman had thrown my rifle into
the mud, so as to be able to use his hands more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
freely, and was endeavouring to make his way to
the fallen animal. The Turk's high boots came
half off each time he lifted his feet, owing to the
sticky nature of the soil. Luckily, perhaps, for
us it was so sticky, the gun-case, which was
buried in the clay, kept the horse from rolling.
The Circassian and Radford had time to reach his
head. Pulling off the pack-saddle, they divided
the luggage among the other animals. We
gradually gained the summit of the hill.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>

</p>

<p>
It was quite dark when we reached Nalihan,
a village with about 400 houses, and situated in
a corn-growing district. I halted at the house of
the Caimacan. He at once invited me to take up
my abode there for the night. Presently several
visitors appeared—Armenians, Turks, and Circassians—all
eager to question the new arrival. I was
seated in the place of honour, on a rug near the
fire; the Caimacan, who was enveloped in a fur-lined
dressing-gown, sat next me. The rest of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
company took precedence according to the amount
of this world's goods which each one possessed—the
man who had 100 cows being seated next
to the governor, and the humble possessor of a
mule or a few sheep squatting humbly by the door.
</p>

<p>
Asiatics are proverbially reticent. My visitors
stared at each other, and did not say a word. At
last the Caimacan broke the silence. He was
wrapped up in a fur dressing-gown, and looked
like an animated bundle. He gave a little cough,
and then said, "Is there any news? if so tell us
something." Now the inhabitants of Asia Minor
do not talk about the weather—the state of the
roads replaces that topic of conversation so
interesting to English people.
</p>

<p>
"The roads are very bad," I replied.
</p>

<p>
To this there was no dissent, everybody
chorussed the wish for a railway.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that one will ever be made?"
inquired the Caimacan.
</p>

<p>
"Probably when you have some money in the
exchequer."
</p>

<p>
"We are very poor; why does not your nation
lend us some gold?"
</p>

<p>
"We have already given you more than a hundred
millions; with that money you might have
made railways in every part of Anatolia."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Will there be war?" asked an Imaum (priest.)
</p>

<p>
"I do not know."
</p>

<p>
"If there is," he added, "I shall go—all the
Imaums will go; we will fight by the side of
our countrymen. We will kill all the Muscovites."
</p>

<p>
"Has it not occurred to you," I here remarked,
"that perhaps they may kill all the Turks?"
</p>

<p>
"Impossible! Allah and the Prophet are on
our side; they will fight for the faithful."
</p>

<p>
"What do you think yourself?" now inquired
the Caimacan; "will Russia beat us?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly—that is, if you have no European
allies."
</p>

<p>
"Why so?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, if your Government had to put out
all its strength to conquer the Servians assisted
by only 12,000 Russians, what opposition will it
be able to make to an army of 700,000 Muscovites?"
</p>

<p>
"May their mothers be defiled!" said an old
farmer. "They are always interfering with us.
All my sons have gone to the war, and I—well, if
the Padishah wants me, I will go too."
</p>

<p>
He was apparently an octogenarian. This announcement
on his part was received with great
applause by the rest of the company.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Why do you not give the Armenians arms,
and make them assist?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"They are friends with the Russians," said the
Imaum. "They would turn against us. Have
you Armenians in your country?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"But you are a Christian, and they are
Christians—you must be the same."
</p>

<p>
I now had to explain to the company that
there is as much difference between an English
Protestant and an Armenian Christian, as between
a Sunnite and a Shiite.
</p>

<p>
"And do you hate the Armenians as much as
the Shiites hate us?"
</p>

<p>
"We do not hate anybody. Our religion does
not allow us to do so."
</p>

<p>
"You Christians are a strange people," said
the priest. Rising, he left the room, followed by
the rest of the visitors.
</p>

<p>
The scenery is very lovely in this neighbourhood,
and as we ascended an incline which leads
in the direction of Angora, I could not help
wishing that I had been born a painter, in order
to have placed on canvas a picture of the landscape.
A succession of hills, each one loftier than
its fellow, broke upon us as we climbed the steep.
They were of all forms, shades, and colours, ash-grey,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
blue, vermillion, robed in imperial purple,
and dotted with patches of vegetation. Our road
wound amidst these chameleon-like heights.
Silvery rivulets streamed down the sides of the
many coloured hills. A rising sun showered its
gleaming rays upon the sparkling cascades. They
flashed and reflected the tints and shadows.
A gurgling sound of many waters arose from the
depths below.
</p>

<p>
We reach the summit of the highest hill.
The scene changes. We look down upon a vast
plain. It is surrounded on all sides by undulating
heights. The white sandy soil of the valley throws
still more into relief the many-coloured mountains.
Patches of snow deck the more distant peaks.
The sun is dispelling the flossy clouds which
overhang the loftier crags. The filmy vapour
floats away into space; caressing for a few
moments the mountains' crests, it is wafted
onward, and then disappears from our view.
</p>

<p>
Now we crossed a rapid stream, about thirty
yards wide, and known as the Alatai river. A
fragile bridge spans the waters. Soon afterwards
we put up for the night at a farm-house in the
village of Tchairhana. The proprietor, a jolly-looking
Turk, received us very hospitably. Later
on in the evening he brought me a large <i>yorgan</i>, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
Turkish counterpane, with the remark that
possibly the Effendi might feel cold during the
night.
</p>

<p>
The Turkish beds are very primitive; no bedstead
being used. One or two mattresses are laid
on the floor, the <i>yorgan</i> takes the place of sheets
or blankets. It consists of a silk quilt, generally
lined with linen, and stuffed with feathers. These
quilts pass from father to son, and are greatly
prized by the Turks. The farmer, to make me
appreciate his attention the more highly, remarked
that the <i>yorgan</i> had been used by his
grandfather, as well as by his father on their
wedding-nights, and that he himself had employed
it on a similar occasion only a few weeks previously.
</p>

<p>
Osman, now interrupted the speaker with the
remark that in his family there was also a
wonderful <i>yorgan</i>—something quite out of the
common, it was so beautiful that neither his wife
nor himself liked to use it—and that this one was
like a furze bush in comparison.
</p>

<p>
"So you are married, Osman?" I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but I have not seen my wife for three
years."
</p>

<p>
"Do you love her very much?"
</p>

<p>
"She is a good cook. She makes soup which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
is more filling than even my brother's here,"
pointing to Radford.
</p>

<p>
"Is she pretty?"
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, I could not afford to marry a good-looking
girl. There was one in our village—such
a pretty one, with eyes like a hare and plump as
a turkey—but she could not cook, and her father
wanted too much for her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what did you give for your present
wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Ten liras (Turkish pounds), but she did not
weigh more than forty okas (about 100 lbs). She
was very cheap. However, her eyes are not quite
straight, they look in different directions. But
that does not signify—she can cook."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the farmer, "a good cook, Effendi,
that is what I said to myself when I wanted a
wife. Looks don't last, but cooking is an art
which the Prophet himself did not despise."
</p>

<p>
I had no reason to congratulate myself on
being the occupant of the farmer's nuptial couch.
It was very old and very beautiful, but it was full
of fleas, and they gave me no rest.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to burn that quilt," I observed
next morning to the farmer; "I have not closed
my eyes during the entire night."
</p>

<p>
"What, burn my grandfather's marriage <i>yorgan</i>—my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
father's <i>yorgan</i>, and my own <i>yorgan</i>!
Never, Effendi! There are fleas, it is true, but
they will die, and the quilt will do for my son and
his wife, if ever he has one."
</p>

<p>
The country which we next traversed was
entirely uncultivated, although it would have
well repaid a farmer. This, however, is the case
with millions of acres in Turkey. There are no
labourers. The country is depopulated to the
last degree, and land which might produce wheat
enough for the whole of Great Britain is left
fallow.
</p>

<p>
Presently we came to an old Khan. It had
been built by a former sultan, as a refuge for
travellers during the winter. At this season of
the year the ground is sometimes covered with
snow for several weeks in succession, and travelling
is very dangerous. Two soldiers were the
sole tenants of the building. Whilst I was performing
my ablutions in the open air, one of them
came to me and asked for a little tea. His
comrade was ill, and tea he thought would be
good for him. I went to look at the invalid.
He was lying on a dirty mattress, and was
shivering violently. It was clearly a case of
fever, so taking some quinine from my medicine-chest,
I administered a dose, and directed his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
comrade to procure a clean bed for the sufferer.
The sick man was very grateful. Eagerly seizing
my hand, he kissed it.
</p>

<p>
"What countryman are you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am English."
</p>

<p>
"Your religion is not that of Islam?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"What are you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a Protestant."
</p>

<p>
"Protestant," repeated the poor fellow, "I
shall remember that."
</p>

<p>
"A Christian," he continued, "even if he had
the medicine, would have let me die like a dog."
</p>

<p>
It was very clear that the sufferer had not
much opinion of the Armenian and Greek
Christians. But this was no solitary expressed
opinion. Throughout my journey, I found Armenians
and Greeks equally despised by the Mohammedans.
It is a great pity that the votaries of
Christianity in the East should have brought the
only pure religion into so great disrepute.

</p>

<p>
There was something on my English servant's
mind that evening. He did not look happy, and
eyed Osman from time to time with lowering
looks.
</p>

<p>
"My brother is angry with me, Effendi," said
the Turk, in answer to my inquiries. "When he
speaks I do not understand, when I speak he does
not know what I say."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, Radford?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Please, sir, I ain't had no dinner. I did not
prepare anything for you as the cook in the house
was a preparing it. Well, when you had finished,
and Osman had brought out the dishes, I thought
that I should get something to eat. But, no sir!
for Osman invited a lot of dirty Turks to come
and sit round the victuals. Some of the chaps
had just come out of the stable, and their hands
were that dirty. Then they began a shoving
them into the dishes and a licking their fingers.
It turned me hup, that it did. Osman ought to
know better, sir. Whenever I cooks for you I
always give him a tit-bit for himself."
</p>

<p>
I now explained the matter to Osman, and at
the same time informed him that in future he
must look after his English companion at dinner-time.
The difficulty was amicably arranged, and
the two men shook hands together. Osman wishing
to show his affection in a more demonstrative
manner, this, however, was not appreciated by
my domestic.
</p>

<p>
"Lor! how they kisses each other, just like a
lot of great girls. Do the Roossians kiss each
other?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Radford."
</p>

<p>
"They must be a poor lot then, sir. I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
always heard that one Englishman could lick two
Frenchmen, and I believed it; but I'll be blessed
if I could not lick half-a-dozen Roossians, if they
have no more in them than these 'ere dirty
Turks."
</p>

<p>
We left Bei Bazar at daybreak. Osman, as
usual, did not take the trouble to lead one of the
baggage-horses, but drove the animal before him.
Presently we passed through a narrow passage.
On each side were two walls; the pack-saddle
struck against one them, and Radford's bag, containing
the article which he prized perhaps most
in the world, some pig tobacco, was torn open.
</p>

<p>
"I never seed such a fellow as that Osman,"
exclaimed my indignant servant, "he is always a
telling of us as how he is industrious, and if there
is a ha'porth of work to do he will borrow a penny
and give it to some chap to do the job for him.
I believe, sir, as how that fellow is a cheating the
horses of their forage. He told me that he fed
them in the morning before I was up. He is a liar
he is. I was dressed a long time before him, and
when he did show himself, he was busy the whole
time a praying and a doing something with a little
gallipot he carries in his saddle-bags. I don't
believe the horses have had a feed of corn this
twenty-four hours."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I began myself to be a little sceptical about
Osman's honesty. I was paying as much for the
forage of the five horses as if I had been in
England. The poor brutes were getting thinner
every day. I determined to stop at a farmhouse
and buy some barley. On giving this to the
horses, they ate it ravenously, thus confirming my
suspicions.
</p>

<p>
"Osman, you did not feed the horses this morning!"
I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Feed them, Effendi! I fed all of them!"
</p>

<p>
"But see how hungry they are, they have eaten
all the barley you have just given them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, they are wonderful horses. They
are always hungry. It is a good sign in a horse
to be always hungry."
</p>

<p>
I was not to be taken in by this remark, and so
desired Radford in future to see the horses fed.
At the same time I resolved to keep a sharp look-out
on Osman. It was true that a considerable
portion of his time was spent in praying; however,
I began to be of my English servant's
opinion, that when the Turk was not engaged
in prayer, he was either planning or executing a
theft, and that all these devotions were performed
merely with the view of throwing me off my
guard.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We crossed the Tchechmet; it is a tributary
of the Sakaria river, and about thirty yards
wide. There was a wooden bridge over the stream,
but without any parapets; the height from the
water being about twelve feet. This river is fordable
in many places, the banks are not precipitous,
and the bottom is firm.
</p>

<p>
A messenger, sent forward from the village of
Ayash, had informed the Mudir at Istanos, our
next station, that an English traveller was on the
road. The official, attended by the Cadi and two
or three Zaptiehs, came out to meet us. All the
party, with the exception of the gendarmes,
were clad in long dark blue dressing-gowns,
which draggled some distance below the riders'
stirrups. The mule which the Cadi rode was
not of a quiet disposition; from time to time
he kicked as violently as a mule can kick, at
his master's robe, the Cadi saving himself by
clinging convulsively to the high pommel of his
saddle.
</p>

<p>
Istanos is a little distance from the direct
road to Angora. There was no other good
halting-place in the neighbourhood, so I determined
to make a slight detour and remain there
for the night—the more particularly as Istanos
is a village of historic fame, the tradition being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
still extant, that it is the place<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> where Alexander
the Great cut the Gordian knot. The village,
which contains 400 houses—half belonging to
Armenians, half to Turks—is on the right bank
of the river Owas. A lofty rock overhangs the
stream, and according to the Mudir, there were
several huge caverns which in days long gone by
had been inhabited by bands of marauders.
</p>

<p>
Later on, I procured a guide, and walked to
the foot of the rock. A narrow pathway was
cut in the solid stone. The track was not more
than twelve inches wide, as we ascended it
became narrower at every moment. At last we
arrived at a spot where the path had given way.
There was a chasm about twelve feet wide.
The guide hesitated, and no wonder, for if he had
essayed the leap and missed it, he must have
fallen at least a hundred feet on to the crags
below.
</p>

<p>
"Effendi," he said, "I will try and cross if
you like, but if my foot slips I shall be killed.
You can see the entrance to the caverns from the
place where you are standing."
</p>

<p>
It was not possible, even if I had wished it, to
pass him and try the jump myself. The sun
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
was nearly down, and ere a rope could be brought,
night would be upon us. Reluctantly I retraced
my steps, having to go backward for some
distance owing to the narrowness of the ledge.
Should any other traveller chance to visit
Istanos, and be able to stay there a day or two,
it would be well worth his while to procure a
rope and examine these, as far as I can learn,
unexplored grottos.
</p>

<p>
On returning to the Mudir's house, I found a
levee of the principal inhabitants, Armenians as
well as Turks. I was then informed that they
had come to welcome me to their village. The
real reason being that they wished to hear the
latest news from Constantinople. No newspapers
find their way to these out-of-the-way villages.
The inhabitants can only learn what is going on
in the capital through the arrival of a traveller.
</p>

<p>
An old Armenian priest was one of the visitors.
He sat by the side of the Mudir, on a raised
platform in the centre of the room. The legs of
these two gentlemen were entirely hid from view,
and although the room was very chilly where I
was sitting, the rest of the party did not seem to
feel the low temperature. I now discovered that
there was a hole in the platform. A pan of live
charcoal had been placed in the recess. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
natives, enveloped in furs, and with their feet
over the embers, were able to withstand the cold.
The platform was partly covered with a Persian
rug. A divan alongside the walls made up
the furniture of the room. In the background
and near the door stood the servants
of the Mudir, and the less important inhabitants.
It was not considered etiquette for them to sit
in the presence of their superiors. They remained
with arms folded and eyes bent down
in token of humility. When the Mudir thought
that they had humbled themselves sufficiently,
he made a sign to them. They all squatted
down on their haunches.
</p>

<p>
"Has the Conference commenced?" inquired
the Mudir.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"What is it all about?" said another old Turk,
the Cadi.
</p>

<p>
"It is to see if arrangements can be made so
as to prevent war," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"But we do not want to go to war with any
one," said the Mudir. "Russia wishes to go to
war with us."
</p>

<p>
"Why is the Conference not held at St. Petersburg?"
asked another of the visitors.
</p>

<p>
"Because Russia is strong and we are weak—the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
other powers are afraid of Russia," said the
Cadi.
</p>

<p>
"Do Englishmen like Russia?" inquired the
Mudir.
</p>

<p>
"Some do, and some do not," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Do you?"
</p>

<p>
"I like the people, but do not like the government."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because it is a despotic form of government,
and in my opinion all despotisms are
bad."
</p>

<p>
"I like to hear that," said the Mudir.
</p>

<p>
"So do I," said each one of the assembled
guests, taking the cue from the governor.
</p>

<p>
"Will England be our ally in the case of war?"
asked the Cadi.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know, but I hope so."
</p>

<p>
Some one now entered and spoke a few words
to the Mudir. The latter left the room: he was
followed by the rest of the visitors, with the
exception of the Armenian priest.
</p>

<p>
"How do you like the Turks?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Very well," replied the old man, at the same
time blowing his nose in his dressing-gown,
pocket handkerchiefs being apparently unknown
in this part of Turkey. "Here," he added, "the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
population is half Armenian and half Turk,
this makes a considerable difference. In other
villages, where the Mohammedans outnumber the
Christians, the latter sometimes suffer."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by suffer? Are they
tortured?"
</p>

<p>
"No, never," replied the priest, "but if a Turk
were to strike an Armenian, and the latter were to
hit him back, all the Turks in the neighbourhood
would set upon the Christian. Then, if the Christian
should complain to the Mudir, the Turk would
bring witnesses to say that the Armenian called
him the grandson or great-grandson of a dog.
The Christian's word would not be taken as
evidence. But things are much better than
they used to be, and here we get on well with
the Mussulmans."
</p>

<p>
My English servant was very much excited that
evening. At dinner-time he put down my plate
with a bang on the table, and every now and
then looked at Osman with an air of supreme
contempt.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?" I at last inquired.
"Have you and Osman been fighting, or are you
both in love with the same woman?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, but that Hosman he ain't taken the
pack-saddle off our horse's back since we left
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
Scutari. Every night I tells him about it, and
he takes no notice of me whatever. I expect that
our oss has an awful back—a nasty unfeeling
brute is Hosman, sir. How would he like a
saddle on his own back night and day for fourteen
days?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said, "go to the stable, take off the
saddle, and tell me in the morning if the horse's
back is sore or not."
</p>

<p>
I did not share the apprehensions of my
English servant. The Turkish pack-saddle is
admirably suited for a long journey. During
previous expeditions in the East, I had seen
some Tartars who kept their horses saddled for
weeks and even months together, and all this
without in any way injuring the animals. The
two English riding-saddles which I had
brought from Constantinople, had already proved
a source of annoyance to me. Our steeds had
lost a great deal of flesh, owing to the long and
frequent marches, and the panels required fresh
stuffing. The grey horse which I rode had
been slightly rubbed. In consequence of this I
had changed saddles with Osman, who was much
lighter than myself. The Turkish saddle not
having a panel, is better adapted for long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
marches. Unfortunately it is an uncomfortable
one for the horseman: my own experience being
that the English saddle galls the steed, but the
Turkish one the rider.

<p>
"Well, how is the animal's back?" I inquired of
Radford, when he awoke me the next morning.
</p>

<p>
"I can't make it out, sir. I took the saddle
off, and our horse ain't touched at all. Osman
came in when I was a looking at him. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
laughed and said 'Eyi' (good), and I said 'Eyi'
too. But, sir, it is a wonder to me that the horse
ain't got an awful back."
</p>

<p>
"How are you getting on with your Turkish?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Capital, sir; I often have a talk with Osman,
though I can't say as how we understand each
other much. The fellow, he knows more about
horses than I thought he did; one lives and learns,
even from Turks."
</p>

<p>
We were escorted out of Istanos<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> by the Mudir
and his two sons, lads of from twelve to fifteen, who
had got up at daybreak to speed the Frank on his
way. The Armenian priest also came to the door.
In spite of the early hour, a great many inhabitants
had assembled on the house-tops to
have a look at the Englishman and his party.
</p>

<p>
"They like your nation," said the Mudir, as the
people saluted us.
</p>

<p>
"Why so?"
</p>

<p>
"They remember the Crimean war, and think
that you have come to help us against the
Russians."
</p>

<p>
"I wish I had," was my answer; "but I am
here only as a 'traveller.'"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We retraced our steps along the route of the
previous day, marching for some time by the
bank of the river. Presently I came to a well-built
stone bridge. It spans the stream, which is
here about forty yards wide, besides being very
rapid and deep. Soon afterwards the path traversed
a spacious plain, formerly the battle field
of Tamerlane. At one end of this plain, and
on a hill, or rather ridge of hills, is Angora.
Its ruined battlements and lofty minarets stand
out conspicuously. The town itself lies rather in
the background and on a slope. A Zaptieh met
us as we were entering a narrow street, and
said that a Turkish gentleman had sent him to
escort me to his house.
</p>

<p>
On we rode, through many dirty lanes, until
I finally entered a wide yard. This court was
overlooked by a large and handsome building.
</p>

<p>
"Suleiman Effendi lives here," said the Zaptieh.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman to whom he alluded now appeared
descending some stone steps which gave
access to the courtyard. He approached us, and
aided me to dismount; then, taking my hand, he
led me into a large room furnished with chairs, as
well as with a divan, and carpeted with rich
Persian rugs. Advancing to the place of honour,
in the centre of the divan, he asked me to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
seated, and sat down by my side. Several of his
friends being accommodated on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Suleiman Effendi was dressed in European
fashion, with the exception of his fez. He had a
very fair knowledge of Arabic; I soon found that
he was well posted in European politics.
</p>

<p>
"I heard that an Englishman was on his way
to Angora," he said, "and determined that you
should be my guest. We received the news about
you from Ismid."
</p>

<p>
"Are there any other Englishmen here?" I
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Only one—the Vice-Consul, a merchant: but
I will send and let him know that you have
arrived. In the meantime have a glass of raki."
Proceeding to a cabinet in the wall, Suleiman
carefully unlocked it, and produced a decanter
with some glasses.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, I do not drink spirits."
</p>

<p>
"No more do I," replied Suleiman, laughing;
"only medicinally, you know;" and he drank off
a bumper.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes the English Vice-Consul
arrived. He was dressed in his official uniform,
and was accompanied by a young Bulgarian, who
was a merchant in the same business as himself.
</p>

<p>
Mr. —— was very surprised to see an Englishman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
in Angora, no one of our nation having visited
that town for several years past; and he informed me
that a telegram had just been received from Constantinople
with reference to the proclamation of
a Constitution. In consequence of this the town
of Angora was to be illuminated on the following
evening; cannon would be fired, and the Pacha
would read the telegram to the populace in the
courtyard of the palace.
</p>

<p>
"What does it—the Constitution—mean?" I
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Mean?" replied the Bulgarian, who spoke
English perfectly; "it means a quantity of promises
which the Government will never fulfil."
</p>

<p>
"It probably means a Parliament in Constantinople,"
said the Consul; "but we have no
particulars as yet." And, making an appointment
for me to call upon him in the morning,
he left the room, accompanied by the Bulgarian.
</p>

<p>
I was very much surprised at this intelligence.
A Parliament in Constantinople! How would
the members be chosen? and who would
choose them? If universal suffrage prevailed,
only one in about every 300 of the electors would
be able to read or write; all of them would be
ignorant of everything beyond the interests of
their immediate neighbourhood.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Is a Parliament possible here?" I inquired of
my host.
</p>

<p>
"It is possible in theory, but impossible in
practice,"<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> was the reply. "We require more
liberty, but this must be a question of time.
We must educate the people, and teach both
the Christians and Mohammedans that a difference
of opinion on religious matters is not a subject
about which men should quarrel. Religion
has been the cause of more wars than anything
else in history."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what it is," he continued, "I believe
that in another hundred years there will be either
no religion at all, or else that every religion will
be merged into one creed."
</p>

<p>
"The Christian," I observed.
</p>

<p>
"Who knows?" continued my host. "We live
in strange times; even we Turks, the more particularly
those who live in Constantinople, begin
to argue about such matters. However, there is
one thing I cannot understand about you Christians—you
appear to me to have so many
roads to heaven. For instance, in Anatolia
there are American Protestant missionaries,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
Italian Catholic missionaries, and then there are
the Armenians, who profess the Armenian faith."
</p>

<p>
"Well," I remarked, "what of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a moment," said my host. "An
Armenian, who is of the Armenian faith, is half-way
up his staircase to heaven. An American
missionary calls after him, 'Where are you
going?' 'I am going to heaven.' 'No you
are not; that is not the road to heaven. You
are going in the wrong direction. Come down
immediately, and I will show you the way.' The
Armenian descends the steps, and begins ascending
the road the missionary points out to him. Presently
another voice is heard. It comes from the
mouth of an Italian missionary. 'Where are you
going?' 'I am going to heaven.' 'No you are
not; come down immediately. You are on the
road to hell.'"
</p>

<p>
"The result is," continued Suleiman, "that the
poor Armenian does not know which way to turn.
He is perpetually going up, or coming down the
steps, and he never reaches his destination."
</p>

<p>
"Stop," I said, "you Mohammedans are
also split up into sects. There are the Sunnites
and the Shiites, and you both hate each other."
</p>

<p>
"Alas! it is true," replied my companion, "but
if we have two sects, you, according to what I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
have read, number at least a hundred, and the
members of many of the sects think that every
one else besides themselves must be damned. A
very charitable doctrine that, is it not?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Who was the Bulgarian with our Vice-Consul?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"He is in business with the Vice-Consul, and,
I am sorry to say, does not love us Turks."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because his brother was one of the victims in
the late Bulgarian rebellion."
</p>

<p>
"People in England blame us for the massacres,"
continued Suleiman. "What could we
do? Our regular troops were employed elsewhere.
This was owing to the intrigues of Russia;
we were obliged to employ Circassians. The
Circassians hate the Russians, and indeed they have
reason to hate them. Those whose own mothers
and sisters have been ravished and butchered,
cannot be expected to love their oppressors.
The Circassians looked upon the Bulgarians as
Russians, hence the bloodshed. A few days ago I
read an extract from an English paper, which had
been translated into Turkish. It was to the
effect that an English priest had seen people
impaled by our Bashi Bazouks. Have you heard
of this?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but the story has been contradicted."
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity when Christian priests or Mohammedan
Imaums mix themselves up in politics,"
remarked another Turk; "their place is to calm
men's passions, not to rouse them."
</p>

<p>
They left me; my host having previously
asked at what time I should like to dine, with
the observation that his hour was mine. Three
servants were also placed at my disposal, with
orders to supply me with anything I might require.
</p>

<p>
The following morning I called upon the Vice-Consul,
and found him at home with his wife—a
delicate-looking lady, who had braved all the
hardships of the journey from Ismid in order to
be at her husband's side.
</p>

<p>
Their house was furnished with every English
comfort. It was difficult to believe that we
were so many days from a railroad.
</p>

<p>
"That piano cost us a great deal of trouble,"
said the Vice-Consul. "It was brought here in
two parts, and on mules."
</p>

<p>
"It is wonderful how it could have survived the
journey," said the lady. Going to the instrument,
she sounded the notes, which were very fairly in
tune. "The Turkish ladies are so astonished
with the piano," she continued. "They will sit
for hours and listen to me playing."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I now started with the Consul to pay a visit to
the Pacha. We arrived in a large courtyard,
which was badly paved with loose stones.
At one end there were some steps which led to
the official residence. The courtyard was thronged
with people who had been summoned to hear the
telegram read about the new Constitution; men
in uniform, beggars, people with petitions in their
hands, all swearing and jostling each other, as my
companion and myself with difficulty made our
way up the stairs. We were at once admitted
into the audience-room. I found the Pacha, a
tall, good-looking man of middle age, engaged in
placing his seal upon a number of documents
which an official was handing to him. He received
us courteously, and proposed that we should
accompany him to the court below, and listen to
the proclamation of the Sultan's telegram.
</p>

<p>
The Pacha then introduced me to his son, a
young man about twenty; he spoke French
fluently and without any perceptible accent,
having been educated by a French tutor.
</p>

<p>
"We have only one cannon in Angora," he
remarked, "and it is to be fired 101 times. We
are a little afraid that it may not be able to stand
the ordeal."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said his father, "we have only one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
cannon, but we have sent 25,000 men to the war.
We do not require any cannons," he added.
"Our own people are quiet enough. The Russians
will not find it a very easy matter to
reach Angora."
</p>

<p>
We descended the steps; on reaching the
courtyard, the clerk—a wonderful old gentleman
in a green dressing-gown, and with a wheezy
voice—called for silence.
</p>

<p>
The Pacha then announced that the Sultan had
been pleased to grant more liberties to his people,
and that the present autocratic form of government
was to be replaced by a Constitution. The
Imaum, or priest, here said "Amin," equivalent
to our Amen; and the Vice-Consul put on his cap
with the gilt peak, which he had taken off during
the ceremony.
</p>

<p>
The Pacha's son now invited me to visit his
rooms, which were a suite of apartments separate
from those occupied by his father. I found his
book-shelves well stored with scientific French
works, and, to my surprise, discovered that the
young Bey was not only remarkably well educated
for a Turk, but was much better informed than
nine Englishmen out of ten who have been to a
public school, and have taken their degree at the
university.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you think will be the result of
the new Constitution?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"We are what you would call in England a
very conservative nation. This sudden change
has almost taken away our breath. We have not
yet received the document which contains all the
clauses of the new Constitution, and only know of
them by telegram; if we are to attempt a form
of Government such as you have in England, in
my opinion we shall fail."
</p>

<p>
"Why so?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because not only the electing class, but the
men who will probably be chosen to sit in
Parliament are only half educated. We shall
have ignorant legislators legislating for an equally
ignorant nation. We want time," he continued;
"we require roads and railways. If there were
means of communication, the people would travel
and see that there is a good deal to be learnt
away from home, and even from you Christians.
Give us roads and railways, they will be worth
fifty Constitutions, for the latter, in my opinion,
will soon be found impracticable."
</p>

<p>
"It will never be carried out," said the Vice-Consul,
who was sitting next to him. "It has
been drawn up merely as a sop for the plenipotentiaries
at the Conference."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well, whatever they do in other places," said
the Bey, "we shall carry it out in its integrity
here."
</p>

<p>
As he said these words the boom of the cannon
resounded from below, the windows of the room
began to rattle, the sound of a mob cheering,
rapidly followed the report.
</p>

<p>
"A great deal of noise and a great deal of
smoke: <i>voilà la Constitution</i>, " said the Consul, and
he prepared to leave the room.
</p>

<p>
"Stop," said the Bey, "you must not walk, I
will send my carriage with you. It is almost the
only carriage in Angora," he added, "and I have
a compatriot of yours as a coachman; he has been
with me three years."

</p>

<p>
The Pacha's carriage was a funny-looking old
vehicle. It gave me the idea of a broken-down
four-wheeler, which had been taken to pieces and
converted into an Irish car. There were no springs.
My bones were nearly dislocated as we drove
down the main street, to the Consul's house.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The coachman turned out to be not an Englishman,
but an Irishman. He had lost all signs of
the native drollery. Four years spent in Turkey
seemed to have taken the life out of him.
He had been sent home to Ireland during the
previous summer, to buy some carriage-horses
for his master. On returning with his purchases,
a storm arose in the Bay of Biscay. The
captain of the vessel had been obliged to order the
crew to throw the horses overboard. This, and
the absence of all female society, had weighed
upon Paddy's mind. He only brightened up for
one moment when the Consul, giving him a glass
of whisky, desired him to drink it in honour of
Ould Ireland and of Christmas Day. For it was
Christmas Day in Angora, and the Consul's good
wife was busily engaged in all the mysteries of the
<i>cuisine</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You are going to dine with us to-night?"
said the hospitable gentleman. "Nay, you must,"
he added. "We are to have a turkey stuffed
with chestnuts, and my wife is busy teaching the
Turkish servants how to make a plum-pudding.
You will also meet some of the celebrities of
Angora."
</p>

<p>
At dinner one of the guests—if I remember
right, an Armenian—did not seem to share the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
opinions which the Pacha had expressed that
morning with reference to the quiet and good
order in the city.
</p>

<p>
It appeared, according to this person, that
there is a vagabond society, a society of thieves, in
Angora, which preys upon Turks and Christians.
The members of this society go at night to
different houses, and, knocking at the door, order
the proprietors, under threat of assassination, to
draw the bolts. The inhabitants, who are frightened
to death, frequently open the door. The
thieves, entering, eat what they find in the house,
and afterwards make the proprietor give them a
sum of money.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," remarked another guest, "the worst
of it is that several of the chief people in the town
are said to be mixed up in this society."
</p>

<p>
A great fire had taken place in Sivrisa, a short
time before. Damage had been done to the Christian
inhabitants to the amount of thirty million
piastres. The Turks did not willingly receive the
Armenians into their houses, but when they
did so, subsequently threw their mattresses
out of the window, saying that they had been
defiled by the contact of a <i>giaour's</i> body. This
was mentioned to show the fanaticism of the
Turks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
</p>

<p>
However, during my subsequent travels in Armenia,
the impression gradually dawned upon my
mind that the Turks were, first of all, very wise
not to wish to receive the Armenians into their
houses; and, secondly, if they had been good-natured
enough to do so, to destroy the mattresses
after the departure of their guests. The Armenians
in their habits of body are filthy to the last
degree. Their houses and clothes are infested
with vermin. The Turks, on the contrary, are much
cleaner, and are most particular about the use of
the bath. An Englishman would not be pleased
if his house became filled with what it is not here
necessary to mention. If he did under such
circumstances admit strangers, he would probably
destroy their bedding the moment that they
departed.
</p>

<p>
One of the visitors now remarked that there had
been ten Pachas in four years in Angora, and that
this frequent removal of officials was one of the
causes which had led to the decadence of the
country.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said another, "a Pacha never feels sure
of his place. Another evil here is the delay
in settling cases of litigation. The arrears are enormous,
and although in November, 1875, a firman
from the sultan called attention to this matter, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
ordered all law cases to be settled at once, nothing
has been done to carry the edict into execution.
If when the Authorities find that they have a
good man as a Pacha, they would leave him for say
ten years in office, we should advance much more
rapidly than at present."
</p>

<p>
I next heard that Angora had not recovered
from the effects of the famine which had devastated
the neighbourhood in 1873-74, the amount of
taxes owing by the inhabitants to the Government
amounting to more than a million and a half
Turkish pounds. The arrears of taxes owing
previous to 1872 had been cancelled, some being
as much as ten, twelve, and twenty years due.
Previous to cancelling the arrears, the Government
had put up to auction the right of collecting the
entire sum; but, as many of the inhabitants had
emigrated, no one ventured to bid.
</p>

<p>
There were 18,000 deaths in the neighbourhood
of the town during the famine, and 25,000
people died subsequently in consequence of its
effect. The chief trade of the district is in goats'
hair, 60 per cent. of the goats, sheep, and cattle
had perished. Children had been deserted and
left in the streets; some instances of babies being
eaten by their parents were brought to light.
</p>

<p>
The following morning I received a visit from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
a relative of my host, Hadji Taifik Effendi. It is
said that he will one day be the head of the
Mussulman faith. I found this Mohammedan
divine excessively bellicose in his ideas; he
eagerly desired war.
</p>

<p>
"Why so?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Because an open enemy is better than a
poisoner in your house. Because war must come
some day, and it is better to get rid of a cancer
by sacrificing a limb.<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> Russian agents have been
doing their best to sow discord amongst the
inhabitants of our provinces; this they did during
peace time and whilst a Russian ambassador was
at Constantinople."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said my host, "and an ambassador
who is himself a prime mover in the secret
societies which are agitating Europe. The
Russian Government pretends to be alarmed
at the secret societies, but it is the hot-bed
of all the secret societies in the world.<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> You
may depend upon it," he continued, "that
the massacres which occurred in Bulgaria had
been planned long before the outbreak. Our
regular troops had been purposely sent to other
parts of the empire. The Russian authorities
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
were well aware of what was about to take place,
and were delighted at the effect which it had
upon public opinion in England. One thing,
however, I cannot understand, and this is why
your newspapers always published the accounts
of the Bulgarian women and children who were
slaughtered, and never went into any particulars
about the Turkish women who were massacred
by the Bulgarians, or about our soldiers whose
noses were cut off, and who were mutilated by the
insurgents in the Herzegovina. A Turk values
his nose quite as much as a Christian," he added.
</p>

<p>
I now learned that Hadji Taifik Effendi
had five wives, but that Suleiman Effendi only
possessed one. She was the widow of a rich
inhabitant of the town, and one day seeing
Suleiman pass her windows, was struck by his
appearance. She sent an old woman, as intermediary,
to him. The marriage was arranged;
the lady bringing all her late husband's fortune
to her new spouse.
</p>

<p>
The Turkish law about the distribution of
property after a man's death is rather curious.
If a man dies leaving a daughter, but if at the
same time he has a brother, the daughter and his
brother divide the property. Should he leave two
daughters and a brother, each girl takes a quarter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
his brother the half; if he has one son and a
brother, the brother is left out altogether, and
the son takes everything.
</p>

<p>
That evening I received an invitation to dine
with a Turkish gentleman. My host was one
of the guests; we went together to the place of
entertainment. There was a strange mixture of
nationalities, comprising Turks, Armenians, an
Italian doctor, a certain M. Gasparini, who had
been for some years in Angora, and was a great
favourite with the inhabitants; Greeks, a Bulgarian,
and our Consul, who is a Scotchman.
We passed through a courtyard which surrounded
the house. It was illuminated with
paper lanterns of various patterns. Presently
I found myself in a room surrounded by divans.
The guests were all assembled. In the centre of
the apartment was a table. On it were placed
bottles of red and white wine of Armenian manufacture,
raki, mastic, brandy, and liqueurs, whilst
biscuits, nuts and filberts, with sardines, were on
little dishes interspersed amidst the decanters.
My host, who was a stout and very dark man,
pouring out a bumper, insisted upon all the company
joining him in his libations, then, turning to
M. Gasparini, he complained about the state of
his digestion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well, if you will drink so much," said the
doctor, "you ought not to expect to feel well."
</p>

<p>
"Spirits," said the fat Turk; "I like spirits—they
refresh my stomach, and I become cheerful.
Send me some medicine," he added.
</p>

<p>
"There is no good treating these Turks," said
the doctor to me, in Italian. "They mix up
everything together, wine, spirits, physic, &amp;c., and
then expect to get well. If they would only
carry out their prophet's injunctions, and leave
off drinking wine, they would enjoy much better
health."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear the story of the prophet
and the old women in Mecca?" said one of the
guests who was listening to the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"No, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," observed the visitor, "there is a
tradition that one day an old woman came to the
Prophet and said, 'Oh! only true Prophet of
God, when I die, to which particular heaven shall
I be sent?' The Prophet, who was continually
being bothered by similar questions, and" (aside
to the doctor) "whose digestion on that particular
occasion was very likely out of order, replied
gruffly, 'Go away, go away! There are no old
women in heaven.' Upon this the aged dame
left the house crying. In a short time the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
Prophet's domicile was surrounded by all the
ancient females in Mecca. Their cries became so
loud that they attracted Mahomet's attention;
he went out to them. 'Oh, holy Prophet! holy
prophet!' they cried. 'Well, what do you
want?' 'You have said that there are no old
women in heaven. Whatever shall we do?' The
Prophet was not in the least nonplussed for an
answer. 'Quite true,' said Mahomet, 'quite
true, I said so. There are no old women in
heaven; they all become young so soon as they
arrive there!'"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>

<p>
By this time the guests had consumed many
cigarettes, smoked numerous Nargilehs, and
drank freely of the liqueurs. The host, rising,
proposed that we should adjourn to the dining-room.
There we found three musicians with
instruments much resembling banjos.
</p>

<p>
"We are to have some music," said the Bey,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
the Pacha's son, who was one of the guests. "I
am afraid that it will not be much to your taste.
Our melodies are very different to those which
you are accustomed to hear in Europe."
</p>

<p>
He was quite right; Turkish melodies are very
different. There is a wildness and pathos about
many of them which strikes the stranger accustomed
to the more regular measure which
distinguishes European music. Now they resounded
so plaintively that the guests involuntarily
ceased talking. Another instant the
instruments, bursting forth with a startling crash,
half deafened us with the clamour.
</p>

<p>
The performers swung their heads from side
to side, and kept time with the quickening air;
the strains went faster and faster. The guests
were inspired with the musicians' enthusiasm.
All the heads began to swing, we Europeans
involuntarily marking the time with our feet on
the floor. The musicians panted with their
exertions. Suddenly the melody left off abruptly,
and one of the performers commenced a doleful
dirge. This did not last long, and when he
was in the most pathetic part, another crash from
the orchestra interrupted him in the middle of a
verse.
</p>

<p>
"Turkish music is exactly like a Turkish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
dinner," observed one of the guests; "it is a
series of surprises; the leader of the orchestra
goes from <i>andante</i> to a racing pace without any
<i>crescendo</i> whatsoever; the cook in the same
manner—he first gives us a dish as sweet as
honey, and then astonishes our stomachs with a
sauce as acid as vinegar. Now we are eating fish,
another instant blanc-mange. A vegetable is
next placed before us, and our stomachs have
scarcely recovered from their astonishment, when
a sweet soup is served up with some savoury
pastry."
</p>

<p>
The servants, who were much more numerous
than the guests, vied with each other in serving
the different dishes. Twenty attendant domestics
were arranged in Indian file. So soon as the
host made a sign to the leading domestic, each
kind of food was replaced by another, and number-two
servant was prepared with fresh viands, while
number one, who had hurried to the kitchen,
returned with another dish.
</p>

<p>
The table was a raised one, chairs were
placed round it. This was done in honour of the
European visitors. We all ate with our fingers,
each man helping himself according to his rank or
social position. It was not etiquette for a Cadi
to seize a piece of meat before the Bey put his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
fingers in the dish, a captain had to be careful not
to offend the susceptibilities of a colonel.
</p>

<p>
To eat blanc-mange <i>à la Turque</i> requires some
practice; however, the Consul and the Italian
doctor had been for some time in the East, and
used their fingers as readily as a knife and
fork.
</p>

<p>
At last our dinner was over. Fruit, mincemeat,
dishes of vegetables, sweets and raisins,
salads and creams, concluding with a huge bowl
of boiled rice, had been disposed of, the whole
having been washed down by tumblers of red
country wine very like Burgundy.
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to God!" said our host, rising; his
example was followed by the rest of the guests.
</p>

<p>
A servant poured water over the hands of the
visitors, beginning with each man according to
his rank. We adjourned into another room. Here
coffee, <i>tchibouks</i>, and <i>nargilehs</i> were handed round
to the company.
</p>

<p>
A servant now approached, and said that
Osman was waiting outside, and wished to speak
to me.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" I inquired. "Have
you come to tell me how very industrious you are,
or do you want some more money?" I had
previously observed that when Osman wished to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
speak to me, these two topics were almost invariably
the subject of his conversation.
</p>

<p>
"No, Effendi, but the horse—"
</p>

<p>
"Which horse?"
</p>

<p>
"The bay that makes a noise."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what of him?"
</p>

<p>
"He is lame. My brother has seen him. I
have seen him. He will not be able to carry his
pack to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Hire two horses instead of one, and lead the
roarer."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Effendi, that is what I have been trying
to do; but the people ask for many liras; their
hearts are stony at the sight of our difficulties,
they open wide their purses for the Effendi's
gold."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been to the post?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but the postmaster has ten horses, and
only one man to look after them. The postmaster
says if you hire two baggage animals that
you must pay for ten."
</p>

<p>
"Wait here, Osman," I said; returning to my
host, I informed him of my difficulties.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! the dog!" exclaimed the Bey. "He is
trying to cheat you!"
</p>

<p>
Tearing a piece of paper from an old letter in
his pocket, he wrote a note to the chief of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
police, desiring him to bring the postmaster immediately
before us.
</p>

<p>
"The postmaster is in bed," said Osman, who
had entered the room.
</p>

<p>
"In bed or out of bed, he shall be brought here,"
said the young Bey, stamping the piece of paper
with his seal, he gave it to a servant. Presently
a noise was heard. The postmaster arrived, followed
by the chief of the police.
</p>

<p>
"You must give this English gentleman two
horses at once."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Bey Effendi."
</p>

<p>
"But why did you not do so before?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I did not know that it was the Bey's
pleasure—the will of the son of our Pacha is my
will. Upon my head be it; the horses shall come."
</p>

<p>
"Good horses," I remarked, "stout and
strong."
</p>

<p>
"Have I not said so?" replied the man, and it
was agreed that I was to hire two horses as far as
Yuzgat, paying the regular tariff of three piastres
for each horse per hour.
</p>

<p>
"People in Turkey who deal in horses are
great rogues," said the Bey; "are they the same
in your country? A horse-dealer near Kars would
try and get the best of his dearest friend in a
bargain."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"They are much the same in England," I replied;
and the young Bey began to tell us some
stories of horse-copers in Aleppo, where he had
passed some years, and in which town the fair sex
was more than usually frail.
</p>

<p>
"The young men in that city have a curious way
of showing their affection to the lady of their
choice," continued the speaker. "A girl has, say,
three lovers—a small allowance for a lady in that
part of the world—she does not know which to
select, each one of the suitors is eager to display
his gallantry."
</p>

<p>
"What does she do?" asked one of the party.
"Accept them all?"
</p>

<p>
"No, she takes three bits of live charcoal from
out of the fire; giving each of her lovers a piece,
she tells them to place it in the palms of their
hands. The fire burns through the skin, the
tendons are laid bare; sometimes the amorous
gentlemen will resist till the flesh has been burnt
to the bone. Here one or two of them generally
succumb to the torture; the man who resists the
longest, wins the lady."
</p>

<p>
"But if they are all equally indifferent to pain,
and the charcoal burns out, what happens then?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"The lady takes three more pieces of charcoal,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
and begins again with the other hand," replied the
Bey. "The more they resist, the better the girl
likes them, because it is a proof to her mind
that they value her more than their own
torture."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever try it?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said the Bey, laughing. "I can get a
wife without any trouble, so I do not care about
burning my fingers. We burn our fingers quite
soon enough after marriage, as it is."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the doctor, and he began to give
me a long account of the domestic life in some of
the harems in Angora.
</p>

<p>
According to the doctor's experiences there was
a great deal of immorality amidst the fair sex in
the city, although nothing to what existed in Yuzgat,
another town which I should pass by on the
way to Kars. In Angora, although the women
are very unfaithful to their husbands, yet everything
is kept more or less concealed. In Yuzgat
it was very different, and there you could actually
see the dance of the Turkish gipsy women, although
in Angora it was strictly prohibited.
</p>

<p>
M. Gasparini was doing a large practice. He
had been established for ten years in Angora and
its neighbourhood. From his position as a medical
man he had the opportunity of knowing more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'>147</a></span>
about the domestic life of the inhabitants than the
other European residents.
</p>

<p>
"Well, although the women may be immoral,
the men are very hospitable," said the Consul.
"Wherever a stranger may go he is always received
with the greatest hospitality. A few
years ago a friend of mine, Mr. Thompson, was
travelling from the Black Sea to Angora. He
arrived at a village. The Khan was full, every
room was occupied. However, he was an old
traveller, and could easily accommodate himself to
circumstances. Taking his cloak, he lay down in
the yard and prepared to pass the night in the
open air. Presently he was awakened by a tap
on the shoulder. On looking up, he found an old
Turk bending over him.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you sleeping here?" inquired the
Mohammedan.
</p>

<p>
"Because there is no room in the Khan."
</p>

<p>
"This is not right. A stranger, and outside
the gate. Come with me."
</p>

<p>
Taking Mr. Thompson by the hand, the Turk
led him to his house, gave him a clean bed and
his breakfast, waited himself upon his guest, and
would not receive any remuneration.
</p>

<p>
"Now," added the Consul, "the Turk was a
Mohammedan, and Mr. Thompson a Christian; if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
the Turk had been in England, and had found
himself placed in a similar predicament to Mr.
Thompson, do you think that there are many
Englishmen who would have behaved so generously
to an utter stranger?"
</p>

<p>
The following day I called upon some Armenian
gentlemen, and found their houses furnished
like my host's, with thick carpets, divans, and
pipes, the walls being bare and whitewashed.
Pictures and looking-glasses were seldom to be
seen, the latter being a very costly luxury, owing
to the difficulty of carriage.
</p>

<p>
The Armenians dressed in a similar manner to
the Turks. The Christian women were closely
veiled whenever they left the house. In many
instances, an Armenian was not permitted to see
his wife<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> before marriage, and had to take her,
as the Yankees say, "on spec."
</p>

<p>
Great harmony existed between the Turks and
Christians. Whenever I dined with an Armenian
there were always Mohammedans present. When
I visited a Turk's house, I generally found Armenians
amongst the visitors. On inquiring
whether this state of things prevailed elsewhere, I
was informed by the Armenians that in other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
parts of Anatolia, and more particularly in Sivas,
the Christians were ill-treated by the Turks, and
that the prisons were filled with Armenians.
</p>

<p>
During my stay at Ismid I had heard precisely
the same story of the sufferings of the Christians
at Angora. I had been told that the Armenians
were cruelly oppressed, and that justice was never
shown to them. However, in Angora the two religions
did not seem to clash. The Mohammedans
and Christians were on the best of terms. I
began to be a little sceptical as to the truth of the
statement about Sivas, and determined not to form
any opinion on the matter from mere hearsay evidence,
but to see with my own eyes if the prisons
were so full of Christians as the Armenians in
Angora would have had me believe.
</p>

<p>
Later on in the day, Radford suggested that it
would be as well for me to sell the lame horse
and buy another; he was doubtful whether,
even without his pack, the animal would be able
to march to Yuzgat. The poor beast was very
lame, the frog of his foot was much swollen.
Whilst we were talking, a Turkish veterinary surgeon
arrived: taking out his knife, he made a
slight incision in the swollen place.
</p>

<p>
Meantime several horse-dealers, learning that I
wanted to buy a horse, brought me some animals
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
for inspection, at the same time offering me
the liberal price of 2<i>l.</i> sterling for my own
animal.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said one man, extracting some silver
from what appeared to be an old stocking, "I will
give twelve medjidis."
</p>

<p>
"Your heart is very hard, brother, soften it a
little," said Osman. "Our horse shall not go for
less than forty silver pieces. You love your money,
but we love our horse still more."
</p>

<p>
Nobody would give this sum, and as I thought
that possibly the operation performed by the
Turkish veterinary surgeon might benefit the
animal, I determined to wait another day in
Angora. This would also give me an opportunity
of inspecting more closely the old Augustin
monument, one of the curiosities in the town.
</p>

<p>
To my great delight the operation proved successful;
in the evening the horse could walk without
much pain. He would be able to march on
the following morning, and so I gave orders for an
early start. Just before leaving, a servant arrived
from the Pacha's palace. The young Bey, who
had observed that I much admired a work entitled
the "History of the Ottoman Empire," and which
was in his library, had sent it to me as a present,
and hoped that I would do him the honour of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
accepting the book as a memento of my visit to
Angora. There were about ten volumes, the weight
would have been at least twenty pounds, and a
considerable addition to the baggage. Much to
my regret, I was obliged to decline the kind offer.
The hospitality of the Turkish nation is proverbial.
The generosity of the Turks is equally great.
In fact, they carry this virtue to excess. Sometimes
after having admired a horse, I have been
surprised to find that the steed has been sent to
my stable, with a note from the owner, entreating
my acceptance of the animal.
</p>

<p>
I often experienced great difficulty in finding
excuses for not accepting the presents so generously
offered to me by my entertainers. "I
cannot take any more luggage," I would say, if the
present were at all cumbersome. However, if it
were a horse, I could only decline the gift and say
that I had not sufficient servants to look after the
animals.
</p>

<p>
"But I have plenty of servants, take one of
mine; he will accompany you throughout your
journey, and then will return to me," would be the
answer.
</p>

<p>
People in this country who abuse the Turkish
nation, and accuse them of every vice under the
sun, would do well to leave off writing pamphlets
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
and travel a little in Anatolia. There is an old
saying that "the devil is not so black as he is
painted," and in many things writers who call
themselves Christians might well take a lesson
from the Turks in Asia Minor.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV.
</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
We leave Angora—The Effendi wants a turkey—A very old cock—The
cooking-pot—An Armenian woman on horseback—Baggage
upset in the river—Cartridges in the water—Osman
castigating the delinquent—Delayed on the road—Asra
Yuzgat—How the inhabitants build their houses—The
Caimacan—His house—His servants undress him—He
goes to bed—All the cartridges spoiled.
</p>

<p>
My host was up at daybreak to see me off.
</p>

<p>
"Come and see me in England," I said.
</p>

<p>
"If Allah pleases, I will," was my friend's
reply, and I only hope that I may have the opportunity
of returning Suleiman Effendi's hospitality.
</p>

<p>
The road was hard and good for a few miles,
we rode for some time by the Ayash river.
</p>

<p>
After marching for about five hours, we came to
a small farm-house. It was on the opposite bank of
the river to ourselves; but there was a ford, and
as there was no wood on our side of the stream, I
determined to cross and halt an hour for lunch.
The house belonged to an Armenian. It was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
filthily dirty. Vermin could be seen crawling
in all directions on the rugs. In consequence of
this, I resolved to make our fire outside, and lunch
in the open air. There were some turkeys in the
farm-yard, and the proprietor coming up, I desired
Osman to purchase one of the birds.
</p>

<p>
"The Effendi wants a turkey," said Osman to
the farmer.
</p>

<p>
This announcement at once created a great
commotion among the female portion of the
Armenian household—the turkeys being looked
upon by the women in the establishment as their
own particular property.
</p>

<p>
"What for?" said an elderly dame, whose
face was bound up in what appeared to be a dish-cloth.
</p>

<p>
"To eat."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any money?" asked the woman
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Money?" said Osman indignantly; "much
money. We can afford to eat turkey every day!
Now, then, how much for this one?" pointing to
an old bird, apparently the paterfamilias of the
brood.
</p>

<p>
"Osman is an ass, sir," here interfered Radford.
"That is a very old cock. Osman has his
eye on him because he is the biggest, he thinks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
that we can chew leather, that he do." And pursuing
the brood, my English servant succeeded in
catching a young pullet, which he brought
triumphantly to the woman.
</p>

<p>
"How much?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve piastres" (about eighteenpence), replied
the woman.
</p>

<p>
"Twelve piastres," said Osman; "it is a great
deal of money—we could not afford to eat turkey
at that rate; say ten, and have done with it."
</p>

<p>
"The bird is a hen, and will have eggs,"
observed the farmer.
</p>

<p>
"She may die and have no eggs, and then you
would have lost ten piastres," said Osman.
"Come, be quick," he added, "pick the turkey!"
And giving the woman the money, the old dame
retired to a little distance to prepare the bird for
the pot.
</p>

<p>
When Radford had finished his cooking, and
had helped me to some of the turkey, he put the
remainder in my washing-basin, and handed it to
Osman, for himself and the man with the pack-horses.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you not give them the cooking-pot,
and let them eat out of it?" I inquired. "Perhaps
they will not like eating out of my washing-basin."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I thought of that, sir; but the pot is that hot
that they would burn their fingers a-shoving them
into it. Nasty, dirty fellows they are too; preferring
dirty fingers to nice clean forks! But
Osman, sir, he ain't that nice. He is the greediest
feeder I ever see, he would eat out of a coal-scuttle
sooner than not fill himself. See there, sir, he has
got that turkey's leg. I knew he would have it!
It was on the baggage-man's side of the basin,
and Osman had eaten already one drumstick: the
other ought to have gone to the chap with the
horses. But Osman ain't got no conscience about
eating, whatever he may have when he is flopping
himself down on my coat and pretending to say
his prayers."
</p>

<p>
After luncheon the two Turks were so long in
loading the pack-horse that I determined to ride
forward with Radford, and let the other men
follow with the luggage. We had continued the
journey for about an hour when, after ascending
a hill, I turned round to see if there were any
signs of my followers. Nothing was in sight
except an Armenian woman, who was on horseback,
she was riding cross-legged, and carried a
baby in a handkerchief which was slung from her
neck.
</p>

<p>
"Had she seen Osman?" I inquired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
Desiring Radford to remain where he was, I
galloped back in the direction of the farm-house.
On arriving by the river-side a singular picture
met my gaze. A pack-horse was dripping from
head to foot, and was without his saddle. All the
baggage was wet through. My cartridges, tea,
sugar, and coffee were spoiled; Radford's bag,
containing his pig tobacco, lay dripping wet
by the side of the river. Osman was swearing
violently at the man in charge of the pack-horses,
and from time to time was administering to him
a blow with a stick across the shoulders. The
chastised individual was sobbing violently. On
seeing me he threw himself down on the ground
and began to embrace my knees.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
They both commenced speaking together.
</p>

<p>
"Stop! One at a time," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you dog!" said Osman to his fellow-countryman.
"How dare you speak? He did
not lead the horse, Effendi, he drove the animal
before him, and the horse lay down in the
river. Everything is spoiled! Oh! you refuse of
a diseased sheep,"—this to the culprit. "And
the Effendi's cartridges, he will not be able to
replace them; and my brother, what will he say
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
about his tobacco? he will be angry—he may beat
me! I knew your mother, your grandmother,
and great-grandmother—they were all most improper
characters—and you, you hound, you are
the worst of the family!" As he said these
words, Osman began to flog the delinquent most
unmercifully.
</p>

<p>
I was obliged to interfere, taking my servant
by the collar, I ordered him to desist, and at once
to load the baggage animal.
</p>

<p>
This accident delayed us considerably on the
road. Some time after sunset, on looking
at my watch, I found that we had only placed
an eight hours' march between ourselves and
Angora. We were on a large plain, which was
surrounded by hills; our path wound round
the slopes of the adjacent height, presently the
village of Asra Yuzgat appeared in sight. It is
built on the side of a hill. We were soon riding
on the tops of the houses, and had to be very
careful lest our horses should suddenly come upon
an open chimney. Some of the roofs had fallen
in. The moon shining on the white rafters gave
a ghastly appearance to the scene.
</p>

<p>
The people in this part of Anatolia have a very
economical way of building their habitations.
The man who is old enough to take unto himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
a helpmate, and who is about to leave his father's
roof, marks a piece of ground, generally of an
oblong shape and on the side of a hill. He next
digs out the earth to the depth of about seven
feet. Then, hewing down some trees, he cuts six
posts, each about ten feet high, and drives them
three feet into the ground, three posts being on one
side of the oblong and three on the other. Cross-beams
are fastened to the tops of these uprights, and
branches of trees plastered down with clay cover
all. A few planks, with a hole made in them to
serve as a doorway, enclose the outer side of
the building, and a broad heavy plank closes
the entrance, hinges being replaced by strips of
cowhide. A wooden railing divides the room
into two parts; one of them is tenanted by
the sheep, oxen, camels, and cows of the proprietor,
the other by himself and family. No partition-wall
separates the cattle from their master;
and the smell which arises at night from the confined
air and from the ammonia in the building is
excessively disagreeable to a European. In cold
weather a hole in the roof, which serves as a ventilator,
is stopped by a large stone. Fuel, often
made from cow's dung, first dried and then
mixed with chopped straw, is thrown on the fire.
The inmates, sometimes consisting of twelve or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
more people, lie huddled together on the floor.
This last in the poorer houses is covered by rugs
made of camel's hair, and in the wealthier establishments
by thick Persian carpets.
</p>

<p>
The barking of the dogs, which swarmed around
us, speedily awoke the inhabitants, and a middle-aged
Turk, clad in a thick brown mantle, approaching
me, said that he was the Caimacan or governor,
and that he hoped I would stay at his house that
night.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that my friend the Bey at Angora
had written to him about my journey, and had said
that I should reach Asra Yuzgat at sunset. The
Caimacan knew nothing of our accident on the
road: as we had not arrived by one hour after
nightfall, he had gone to bed.
</p>

<p>
His house was not a large one. It consisted of
two rooms, a kitchen and a reception-room. The
latter apartment was used for all purposes. The
owner remarked that he was going on a shooting
expedition the following morning; he proposed
that I should join his party. There were,
according to him, a great many partridges and hares
in the neighbourhood. However, my cartridges
had been probably all of them spoiled in the river,
so I was obliged to decline the invitation.
</p>

<p>
I was rather tired, and wished to go to bed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
On expressing a wish to this effect, a mattress
was produced, and put down in one corner, and
a second the other side of the room for the
Caimacan. Three or four servants were present.
No one seemed to have any intention to retire.
I took off my clothes, lay down on the mattress,
and drew over myself a marvellous thing in the
way of <i>yorgans</i>, a silk counterpane of as many
colours as Joseph's coat, and lined with feathers.
</p>

<p>
"Are you warm?" said the Caimacan.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Every one is warm with that <i>yorgan</i>," he continued.
"It is light, and there are no fleas in it.
You will sleep well."
</p>

<p>
He now prepared to go to bed. The four servants
assisted him. First they drew off his boots,
and then his nether garments; the Caimacan
glancing from time to time at me out of the
corner of his eye, probably wishing to see what
impression the fact of his having four servants to
put him to bed had produced on my mind. He
had been astonished when I undressed myself,
and had remarked,—
</p>

<p>
"Why, you have two servants, and you take off
your own clothes! What is the good of having
servants if you do not make them useful?"
</p>

<p>
By this time he was in bed. His attendants
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
lay down by his side; Radford and Osman in
another corner. The one tallow dip which lit the
room was carefully extinguished; soon nought
could be heard save the snoring of the slumberers.
</p>

<p>
I arose at daybreak, and unpacked the wet
cartridges, then, taking my gun, I tried some of
them; snap—snap—they would not explode. It
was no use stopping for the shooting party; so
desiring Osman to commence loading the horses,
I took leave of my host.

</p>

<p>
We rode across a low ridge of mountains, rocks
which looked like iron ore lying about in all
directions, and presently arrived at the Kizil
Ermak, a broad and rapid stream which runs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
into the Black Sea, about fifty miles S.E. of
Sinope. The distance across the river was at
least one hundred yards, the left bank being
very precipitous. The depth of the water,
owing to the recent rains, was not less than
seven feet. There is no bridge in the neighbourhood,
the nearest being twenty-four miles
higher up the river; I was curious to learn how
we should reach the other shore. The guide
soon solved the problem. Riding about half a
mile along the bank, he put two fingers in his
mouth and whistled. In a few minutes the sound
was answered from the opposite side of the river.
Six men appeared in sight. Descending the
bank, they dragged a triangular-shaped barge from
some rushes, and, getting into it, began to pull
with all their might in our direction. The current
was very swift, the starting-point was nearly
half a mile beyond us; but notwithstanding this,
the oarsmen overshot their mark. We had to
lead our horses some little distance before we
reached the boat.
</p>

<p>
It was a queer sort of a craft, certainly not
more than twenty-five feet long, and about sixteen
in its widest part. Its sides were two feet
above the water: the men could not approach the
bank nearer than twenty yards. The bottom was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
muddy. Our horses would have to walk through
the mud to the boat, and then jump over the bulwarks.
</p>

<p>
There were altogether eight horses, my own
four, three belonging to the post, and the animal
the guide rode, a brute which kicked, and already
had slightly lamed my grey.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be drowned," said Osman plaintively,
"I know I shall! Can my brother swim?" pointing
to Radford.
</p>

<p>
"What does he say, sir?" inquired my English
servant.
</p>

<p>
"He wants to know if you can save him if he
falls into the water."
</p>

<p>
"Save him? no, sir. I cannot swim a stroke.
I wonder what our engineers at Aldershot would
say if they had to get us over in such a craft as
this? It is wuss than a pontoon!"
</p>

<p>
The boatmen wanted to take four horses across
at a time; a veto was put upon this proposal on
account of the guide's horse; it was determined
that he should go alone. Taking the saddle off my
own animal, I led him into the water; on reaching
the boat I climbed into it, and tried to make
the horse follow. This was by no means an easy
task, he had sunk at least a foot into the mud,
and evidently did not fancy the leap into the bark.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
Three of the boatmen now got into the river.
One of them, seizing my horse's tail, twisted it
violently, the others poked him from behind with
their oars. Osman all this time was expostulating
with the animal from the bank.
</p>

<p>
"Dear horse, jump in! You shall have as much
barley as you can eat this evening."
</p>

<p>
This argument not having any effect upon the
horse, Osman's language waxed stronger, and he
heaped numerous curses upon the animal's ancestry.
</p>

<p>
"Drat you!" said Radford at last; "you are
always a-talking when there is something to do.
Go and help, can't you?" Suiting the action to
the word, he gave a push to the noisy Turk,
which nearly upset him into the water.
</p>

<p>
At length, and by the exertions of all our
party, my horse was persuaded to make an effort.
Rearing himself up, he placed his two fore-feet
in the boat. A chorus of oaths and ejaculations—the
hind-legs followed. Once safely in, I bandaged
his eyes. The other horses, seeing that
one of their number was embarked, followed
without much difficulty.
</p>

<p>
We floated down the stream for some distance,
and at a great speed, before the boatmen could get
any command over their craft, which whirled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
round as if in a whirlpool. Fortunately the horses
were all blindfolded, and could not see the water.
At last we reached the opposite bank, having
descended the stream for more than a mile from
our starting-point. So much time was lost in
getting the other horses over, that night was upon
us before we reached our destination, Yakshagan,
a large village with two hundred houses. It was
only fourteen miles from Asra Yuzgat, though,
owing to the river, we had employed from sunrise
to sunset in the journey.
</p>

<p>
At Yakshagan it was necessary to hire fresh
post-horses. The official at the station was very
uncivil, and declared that he would not supply me
with any unless I paid for three horses from
Angora. I had only engaged two, however, the
man with them had chosen to bring a third animal,
instead of riding on one of the baggage horses.
At last the difficulty was settled by the guide, who
was known to the postmaster, saying that he
would be responsible for the amount; whilst I
agreed to refer the matter to the authorities at
Yuzgat, and abide by their decision.
</p>

<p>
I started rather late, in consequence of the
altercation. After a five hours' ride along a good
road and through a beautiful country, we arrived
at Madeh. Here there are several silver-mines
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
which, till very lately, have been worked by the
Turks. I was informed that water has recently
found its way into the pits. In consequence
of this the miners had abandoned them.
</p>

<p>
"It is a great pity," said an old Turk, an inhabitant
of the village. "With proper machinery
it would be easy to pump out the water, and
these mines abound in silver."
</p>

<p>
"We have got nothing but paper money in
Anatolia," he added sorrowfully, "all this rich
metal lies buried beneath our feet."
</p>

<p>
It surprises a traveller to find that the Turks
make so little use of their mines. In the course
of my ride from Angora I had passed through a
country apparently abounding in iron, and with
many traces of coal. At Madeh there is silver,
whilst copper is also found in the immediate
neighbourhood. With intelligent engineers to
explore the mineral wealth of Anatolia, Turkey
would be able not only to pay the interest of her
debt, but would speedily become one of the
richest countries in the world.
</p>

<p>
From Madeh we continued the march to Kowakoli.
The country on each side of the road
is covered with vines. The grapes in this part of
Turkey are very large. The inhabitants preserve
the fruit throughout the winter by hanging
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
it up in cellars. The atmosphere is dry;
unless the temperature falls much below zero,
and the grapes freeze, they can be kept till the
early spring. There is no wine made in the neighbourhood.
The Armenians, who in other parts of
Anatolia make large sums of money by distilling
spirits, here neglect this branch of industry. The
grapes are either eaten, or the unfermented juice is
kept to sweeten pastry, for sugar is very dear,
and costs more than a shilling the pound. This
price is beyond the means of not only the poorer,
but even of the wealthier inhabitants of the district.
In consequence of this they drink their
coffee without sweetening it, and look upon a present
of a few pounds of sugar as a donation
worthy of a sultan's generosity.
</p>

<p>
I was hospitably entertained by an old farmer.
He bewailed the disasters caused by the Angora
famine, which had been felt throughout all this
district. The road from Angora had been blocked
by snow for three months and a half. His cattle
all died from starvation, his goats had also
perished. The late Sultan, Abdul Aziz, had sent
large sums of money and food to the suffering
people; but the roads were impassable, and
the provisions could not reach their destination.
Many poor people had died of hunger with cartloads
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
of corn and barley only a few miles from
their doors.
</p>

<p>
My host had one son, a lad about sixteen
years of age. The boy regretted that he was
not old enough to join the sultan's forces.
</p>

<p>
"Your time will come soon enough," observed
his parent.
</p>

<p>
"He does not know what war is like," added
the farmer sorrowfully. "A great many men
have gone to Servia from this neighbourhood, and
several have been killed. God grant, if my boy
should have to go, that he may return to his old
father."
</p>

<p>
"Is there much enthusiasm here for the war?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Immense," replied the farmer; "the people
feel that it is a question not only of religion but
also of property. We landlords should not like
to have Russian assessors grinding us down to
the last piastre. We do not wish to be tortured
to change our religion, and we do not want to be
made soldiers against our will."
</p>

<p>
"But you are all soldiers now," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, because it is the time of war, and it is a
struggle for our very existence. When the fighting
is over, our young men will return to their homesteads,
and gladden their families once more."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that you shall be able to withstand
your foe?"
</p>

<p>
"Allah is always on the side of justice, and He
will give us the victory," rejoined the old man
proudly. "Our land shall drink our blood ere we
give up one foot of soil to the invader."
</p>

<p>
We now rode towards Sekili, a village about
twenty-seven miles from our sleeping quarters.
</p>

<p>
Presently my grey horse began to walk lame.
He had been kicked by the guide's animal on the
previous day. My weight was too much for the
poor little brute. I resolved to change horses
with Osman, who was much lighter than myself.
Calling the Turk to my side, I desired him to dismount,
and then mounted the ambling steed. The
pace of a Rahvan, or ambling horse, is an easy one
for the rider; and the animal can get over the
ground at the rate of about five miles an hour;
the ordinary walk of the small Turkish horses
being not much above three.
</p>

<p>
We passed by some hovels. Their walls were
built of marble; the roofs were made of
beams covered with mud; the pure white rock
presenting a striking contrast to its filthy surroundings.
Marble abounds in this neighbourhood.
Large blocks were lying on all sides of us, and
along our path. Some ruins in the vicinity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
showed that hundreds of years ago the inhabitants
of this part of Anatolia were able to utilize their
quarries.
</p>

<p>
Poor Turkey, she has descended the steps of
civilization, and not ascended them like European
nations.
</p>

<p>
However, though mud hovels have replaced the
marble palaces of the Turk's ancestors, the Turks
themselves remain unchanged. Hospitality—their
great virtue—is as rife in 1877 as in the
days of Mohammed II. No matter where an
Englishman may ask for shelter, he will never find
a Mohammedan who will deny him admittance.
</p>

<p>
We left behind us some mountains of slate,
and rode over rich soil, which had been left
fallow for miles around.
</p>

<p>
"There are not inhabitants enough to cultivate
the land," was the guide's answer to a question
from me about the subject.
</p>

<p>
He was doubtless right. Asia Minor, like
Spain, needs a threefold population to develop
her natural wealth. Let foreign settlers go to
Anatolia. Let them make railways throughout
the country, it could supply the whole of Great
Britain with corn, and the mines of coal and of
other minerals would prove a source of immense
wealth to the inhabitants.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Later in the day we passed a Kurdish encampment.
The Kurds all lived in circular black
tents, and some women, with unveiled faces,
rushed outside the dwellings to see the strangers
pass.
</p>

<p>
The Turkish authorities have great difficulty
in collecting the taxes from this nomad race.
Whenever the Kurds expect a visit from the tax-collector,
they pack up their chattels and migrate
to the mountains. Here they can place the
Turkish officer at defiance, and only return to
the plains when their spies have announced the
enemy's departure. A few years ago the wealth
of the Kurdish sheiks was very considerable;
many of them owned twenty, and even thirty
thousand sheep, besides large droves of horses,
and numerous herds of cattle. The famine, however,
which devastated the province, was as disastrous
for the Kurds as for the Turks. It has
left them in a wretched state of poverty.
</p>

<p>
The Delidsche Ermak, a tributary of the
Kizil Ermak, crossed our path. There was no
bridge, and we had some difficulty in finding a
ford. At last the marks of some horses' hoofs
showed our guide the exact spot: riding into the
stream—here about fifty yards wide—and with
the water up to his horse's girths, he piloted us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
over in safety. The bottom of the river is firm.
I was informed that the stream becomes very shallow
during the summer months; the inhabitants
can then cross it with their ox-carts.
</p>

<p>
The village of Sekili is made up of twenty
mud hovels. Our accommodation for the night
was not of a luxurious kind. But after a long
and tiring march a man speedily reconciles
himself to circumstances. A fire was lit. Two
old hens were stewing in the pot. A kettle full
of tea simmered on the fire; and with a pipe after
dinner, things looked a little brighter than at
first. We next traversed a district abounding
with salt. The soil sparkled in the sun. The
crystal substance was visible for a considerable
distance. Presently some Turkoman girls, with
high, picturesque head-dresses, rode by us at a
gallop: their merry laughter rang in the air as
they passed. Soon afterward we came to their
village, the habitations being nothing more or
less than a few holes in the side of a hill. The
Turkomans pronounce Turkish rather differently
to the Turks. At first I had some little difficulty
in making myself understood. Indeed, a
man must be a polyglot to know all the languages
spoken in Anatolia. Armenian, Greek, Circassian,
Kurdish, Tartar, Persian, Georgian, and Arabic,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
besides Turkish, are heard within a radius of one
hundred miles. The different sounds in these
languages are very puzzling to a stranger who is
trying to perfect himself in Turkish.
</p>

<p>
Some Turkomans, dressed in white tunics,
broad red trousers, and with grey sashes round
their waists, were sitting idly at the entrance to
their burrows. A woman, in a crimson dressing-gown,
and a few girls, with naught on save long
white shifts, and caps, were busily engaged in
drawing water from a neighbouring well. Some
goats, which had descended the hill, were feeding
on the roofs of the houses.
</p>

<p>
We entered one of the dwellings, but so many
fleas were hopping about that I determined to
eat my lunch in the open air. The proprietor
of the hovel was very much surprised at our preferring
the cold outside to the shelter of his
domicile.
</p>

<p>
"My Effendi does not like fleas," said Osman.
</p>

<p>
"There are not many here!" said the proprietor.
"It does not do to be particular. In Sekili," he
continued, "fleas abound, the Effendi ought to
be accustomed to them by this time."
</p>

<p>
"What does he say, sir?" asked Radford, as
Osman gradually explained the Turkoman's remarks
to me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Say! He says that you ought to be accustomed
to fleas by this time."
</p>

<p>
"Accustomed, sir? No, but they are getting
accustomed to me. Haldershot is a joke to this
here Turkey so far as fleas are concerned."
</p>

<p>
Presently my servant continued,—
</p>

<p>
"These Turks, sir, ain't got no decent tobacco,
why a pipeful of cavendish, or good bird's hi, is
worth all the hay they smoke. No wonder people
in England abuse the Turks—and quite right too.
Men who might grow shag tobacco, and prefer
growing hay tobacco, can't be of much account."

</p>

<p>
On the track once more; and now we came to a
large stone, in the middle of the path. This
marked the resting-place of a victim to the recent
famine. The poor fellow had fallen down from
exhaustion, and had died on this spot. It was
too much trouble for the survivors to move his
corpse, they had made a hole and buried him
where he lay.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My grey horse, which Osman was riding, still
went very lame; so I limited our march to six
hours, and stopped at the little village of Daili.
Here there were only fifteen houses. Many camels
and herds of cattle were grazing in the neighbourhood,
and the ground appeared to have been
cultivated for a considerable distance. On this
occasion the fortune of travellers gave us better
quarters. The house in which we were lodged
was clean. A raised dais of wood was set
apart for the servants. Mattresses with cushions
were reserved for the proprietor and his
guests.
</p>

<p>
There were some Turkomans in the village, and
when the news was spread that an Englishman
had arrived, several of them came to see me.
</p>

<p>
"We are so glad to see an Englishman," said
an old man, the spokesman for their party.
</p>

<p>
Osman now interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, they want to tell you that they hate
the Muscovites, and that they hope England will
not allow the Tzar's soldiers to massacre them
like they (the Russians) massacred the Teke Turkomans."
</p>

<p>
"Were many women and children belonging to
the Teke Turkomans killed by the Russians?"
</p>

<p>
The old man shook his head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Many! many!" he replied. "The women
were violated by the soldiers. The little boys and
girls were abused and then murdered. The
men took pleasure in these awful crimes. The
Muscovite is a beast! He is worse than a hyena;
the hyena sucks the blood of his victim, but the
Russian satisfies his lust first, and then tears to
pieces the object of his pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"We hear," he continued, "you have as
Padishah, a lady. What does she think of this
way of treating the Turkoman's little ones?"<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a>
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think yourself?" he added.
"Should not you like to cut the throats of all the
Russians?"
</p>

<p>
This was rather a strong way of dealing with
the question. However, if I had been a Turkoman,
and my own sisters had been treated by the
Russians in the way the Turkoman women have
been, I should have looked upon the matter from
a Turkoman point of view.
</p>

<p>
"They are not all equally guilty," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Equally guilty! Yes they are. From the
Tzar upon his throne to the soldiers who do his
bidding they are a nation of assassins! What is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
the best way to get rid of a wasp's nest?" he now
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Smoke it, and destroy the young ones," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that," said the Turkoman, "is what we
must do with the Russians. We must kill them
all. And Allah will be with us; for He knows
who began the butchery."
</p>

<p>
"Have many men gone from this village to the
army?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Every able-bodied man is serving, and we are
now, all of us, going to the front; greybeards as
well as boys. We feel that it is a war of extermination.
If we do not defend our homesteads,
woe betide us!"
</p>

<p>
On leaving Daili the track was firm and good
for the first three hours; it then became very
precipitous, and led down steep declivities, and
over a succession of boulders. At last we came to
a large circular plain; it was surrounded by hills;
on one side of this vast natural basin, and on a
slope, lay Yuzgat.
</p>

<p>
As we were nearing the walls a cavalcade of
horsemen appeared in sight. One of them advancing
saluted us by touching his fez, and then
addressed me in excellent French. He was a
Pole, Vankovitch by name, and was employed as
chief engineer in the district. He had received
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
a telegram from the Italian doctor, M. Gasparini,
of Angora, to say that I was on the road, and had
ridden out with some Armenian gentlemen to
welcome us to the town.
</p>

<p>
An Armenian now asked me to take up my
quarters in his house. I had been lodged beneath
a Turkish roof at Angora, and was curious to see
the difference between the Christian and Mussulman
mode of living. I gladly accepted the offer.
</p>

<p>
Many more horsemen, Turks and Armenians,
joined us ere we entered the city. I now
learnt that my kind friend, the Bey at Angora,
had telegraphed to some of his acquaintances,
asking them to do what they could to make my
stay at Yuzgat pleasant.
</p>

<p>
The news of the approach of an Englishman
had already been spread through the town.
The inhabitants had all turned out to have a look
at the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"An Englishman in Yuzgat is indeed a surprise
for the inhabitants," said a young Turk
who was riding by my side. "I do not believe
that one of your nation has been here for the last
twenty years. We Turks are not ungrateful," he
continued, with a smile. "We have not forgotten
our old friends of the Crimea, and what you did
for us then."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Please God you will do as much now!" said
another horseman. "Anyhow your arrival has
created an immense excitement; there was not
so great a crowd to see the Pasha of Angora,
when he paid us a visit."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," observed Radford, who, surprised at the
tremendous ovation I was receiving from the crowd,
had gradually sidled up to my horse, "this
reminds me of our riding after Don Carlos in Spain.
Only in Spain, all the people came to look at
Don Carlos, and here they have come to look at us.
Just, sir, for all the world as if we were a Lord
Mayor with his men in harmour riding in state
by the Horse Guards. There have been a lot of
dirty Turks kissing Osman already, so pleased
they seem to see him; and two or three men
were slobbering over my boots as we rode up the
hill!"
</p>

<p>
We entered a courtyard: dismounting, I
ascended some steps which led to my host's
house. The room placed at my disposal was
furnished in a similar fashion to the one which
I had inhabited in Angora. Several servants
hastened to pull off my riding-boots, and the
proprietor said that some Armenians were waiting
outside, they wished to speak to me. "Would
I see them?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"By all means," I replied; "show them in."
</p>

<p>
Several men entered; they were dressed in
various costumes, the dressing-gown pattern being
evidently a favourite amidst the inhabitants of
Yuzgat. The visitors ranged themselves against
the wall in order, according to their social positions,
and then salaamed me. On my returning
the salute, the gentlemen squatted down upon the
floor, and the salaaming ceremony was repeated.
</p>

<p>
"They have come to ask whether you will
honour them by inspecting the Armenian school,"
said my host, who, of higher rank than the visitors,
had not squatted down on the floor, but was
seated with his legs tucked under him on the
divan.
</p>

<p>
"We are all Christians," said an old, and very
dirty Armenian, who looked as if water and he
had long been strangers to each other.
</p>

<p>
"It is a pleasure to see a Christian," he added.
"It does me good."
</p>

<p>
"We are all delighted!" said the rest of the
company. Whereupon we salaamed again.
</p>

<p>
"How do you like the Turks?" I now inquired.
</p>

<p>
"They get on very well together," observed the
Pole, who had accompanied me home, "and the law
is carried out very fairly for all classes. I will give
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
you an instance. The chief of the telegraphs
in Yuzgat is an Armenian. One day he saw a few
Turkish boys teazing some Armenian children,
and calling them giaours. He beat the Turkish
children. Some Turks, coming up, took the
part of the Mohammedan lads, and struck the
telegraph-man. The latter complained to the
authorities; the Turks who had beaten him were
at once imprisoned."
</p>

<p>
"Twenty years ago this would not have
happened," said another of the visitors; "but
here things have altered for the better."
</p>

<p>
"However, at Sivas," he continued, "you will
find that the Christians are horribly ill-treated by
their Pacha. The prison is full of Christians.
There is no sort of justice in that city. The
Pacha takes away Christian little boys and girls
from their parents, and shuts them up in his
seraglio."
</p>

<p>
"Is this true?" I inquired of Mr. Vankovitch.
</p>

<p>
"They say so. But you must remember that
you are in the East," was the Pole's reply.
</p>

<p>
"Personally," he added, "I make a rule to
believe nothing except what I see myself. You are
going to Sivas?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you will be able to judge for yourself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
At all events, the Christians in this town are not
oppressed in any way. You see Armenians and
Turks dining together at the same table, and so
far as justice is concerned, the Christians obtain
quite as much of it as the Mohammedans."
</p>

<p>
The Armenians, who by this time had finished
their coffee, now left the room; and Mr. Vankovitch
remaining behind, began to tell me of his
experiences in Asia Minor, and of the cause which
had induced him to leave his own country.
</p>

<p>
He had been educated in the Military College
at St. Petersburg, and had passed his examination
for the engineers just before the Polish
insurrection. He had joined the rebels, and
taking command of a large band which had
assembled near Vilna, had fought against the
Russians for more than two years. General
Muravieff, known to history by his brutality
to the women of Vilna, published four proclamations
offering rewards for Vankovitch's head.
Fortune favoured the young Pole, who was able
to escape his foes. When the rebellion was suppressed,
he succeeded in reaching Odessa, and
made his way on board a Greek ship bound
for Constantinople. After being two days at
sea, the vessel, owing to bad weather, was
obliged to put back into harbour. The captain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
then said, that as some Russian officers would
be certain to come on board, it would be better
for Vankovitch to remain concealed in a friend's
house, until the ship could sail. He took the
advice; but left all his clothes and other effects in
the cabin.
</p>

<p>
The vessel started that night; he did not
receive any warning, and the captain, carrying off
his luggage, robbed him of everything he had
in the world. The Polish committee in Odessa
raised a little money for their brother in misfortune:
after paying for his passage in another
steamer, he arrived at Constantinople with barely
five pounds in his pocket. This was soon
spent, and then in order to earn his bread, he
obtained employment as a road-maker. The
engineer who superintended the work discovered
that the navvy knew as much about road-making
as he did himself. He promoted him
to be assistant-engineer.
</p>

<p>
Vankovitch complained that he was unable to
write to his father, a gentleman who resided near
Vilna. The engineer had sent two or three
letters; but on each occasion the envelopes were
opened by the Russian police, and the parent had
been heavily fined, simply because Vankovitch
had dared to write to him.

</p>

<p>
My host now returned, and informed me that
M. Perrot, a French author who wrote a book
about Asia Minor, had resided beneath this
roof. On turning over the leaves of the
work, which had found its way to Yuzgat,
I came to a page in which M. Perrot observes
that "one day I inquired of my host why
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
he did not introduce me to the lady of the
house?"
</p>

<p>
"It is our custom," was the reply. "And I
find it a wise one. What good does it do me if
other men see my wife? I took her for myself;
she is my property. I have heard that you Europeans
spoil your wives; mine is educated properly.
When I enter my harem, she comes to
kiss my hand, then she stands upright before me
in a respectful attitude, and she only opens her
mouth when I address her."
</p>

<p>
On showing my host the paragraph, he observed,
"When M. Perrot was here, my father
owned this house. I remember the circumstance
well. I was in the room when M. Perrot
asked my father to introduce him to my mother.
I suppose my parent was under the impression
that in Europe you keep your wives for your
guests; but anyhow we keep our wives for ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"What!" I inquired, "would you not introduce
me to your sisters or mother?"
</p>

<p>
"No, certainly not."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Vankovitch here interposed with the remark
that on the following day my host's niece
was to be affianced to her future husband; that
the bridegroom had not set eyes upon the face
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
of his intended, and no one in Yuzgat, save her
own immediate relatives, had ever seen the young
lady.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I inquired, "and if the wife of an
Armenian is unfaithful to him, can he obtain a
divorce?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied my host; "our religion does
not allow of such a step; he does not even see his
wife's face before marriage."
</p>

<p>
"Then he has no opportunity of studying her
character, and she has no opportunity of studying
his."
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"They are a set of fools," said Vankovitch to
me in Russian, this language not being understood
by the proprietor. "They think that by
shutting up their wives, they can keep them out
of mischief, but the husbands are very much
mistaken."
</p>

<p>
"We need not be surprised at it," he continued;
"an Armenian lady is in no way educated.
She is confined in a harem. She is the
slave of her husband, and has to do all sorts of
menial work for him—wash his feet, rub them
dry, and wait at table. From her earliest childhood
a girl is brought up to consider herself
as a slave in her father's house; until the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
Armenians abandon these barbarous customs,
their so-called Christianity will not do them
much good. A Turkish husband has no difficulty
in obtaining a divorce—in fact he is not even put
to the expense of going to a court of law. All
he has to do is to say, in the presence of a
witness, 'I renounce you,' and he is at once
freed from his wife, who is at liberty to go
where she likes, and marry whomsoever she
pleases."
</p>

<p>
"If a Turk," added Mr. Vankovitch, "once
renounces his wife before a witness, he cannot
withdraw his renunciation. There is a story that
a woman, who wished to be divorced from her
husband, dressed up one of her female slaves in
man's clothes and provided her with false whiskers
and beard. On entering the harem late at night
the husband found this disguised figure lying by
the side of his wife. He was furious, and at once
renounced the, as he thought, faithless lady.
There is a curious law about marrying a divorced
woman which is not generally known by Europeans,"
continued the speaker. "If a Turk has
divorced his wife, but she wishes to return to
him and he to take her, the lady first of all must
be married to some other man, and the rites in
their entirety be accomplished; the new spouse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
then divorces her. After this process she can
return to her former husband.
</p>

<p>
"A husband who wishes to take to himself again
his divorced wife, generally chooses some beggar,
almost always a very old man; he then offers
this elderly individual a sum of money to marry
the lady and afterwards renounce her. Sometimes,
however, there are difficulties in carrying
out these arrangements. The lady takes a fancy
to the beggar, and the beggar to the lady. The
pauper will not divorce her, and the original
husband is laughed at by the rest of the community."
</p>

<p>
There were 10,000 inhabitants in Yuzgat, but
there was very little crime. Only one execution
had taken place during the last fifteen years, and
this had been for murder.
</p>

<p>
The town itself is, comparatively speaking, of
recent date, its construction dating back 130
years. The neighbourhood abounds with mines,
and I was assured that iron, silver, and coal had
been found near the city.
</p>

<p>
The Armenians did not serve in the army as
soldiers; but in lieu of military service, paid the
Ottoman Government twenty-eight piastres thirty-two
paras every year for each male child, from his
birth to his death.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Circassians, of whom there are a great
many in this part of Turkey, are not compelled to
join the army; but they have promised the
Government that every able-bodied man amongst
them shall turn out as an irregular horse or foot
soldier, should his services be required.
</p>

<p>
The people in the province of Angora are
taxed as follows:—If ground is cultivated, the
proprietor gives the Sultan the tithe of the
crop.
</p>

<p>
The owner of a house pays 4<i>l.</i> per 1000<i>l.</i> of the
estimated value of his abode, that is to say, if he
is living in it himself. If on the contrary he lets
it, he must pay 40<i>l.</i> per 1000<i>l.</i> The tax for
people engaged in trade or commerce, is 30 per
cent. on their profits. If a merchant sells corn in
a town, he has to pay a duty of two paras for every
twenty okas of grain purchased from him, and
should he dispose of a horse, sheep, or ox, in the
market-place, he must give the Government 2½
per cent. of the proceeds of the sale. A farmer
has to pay the Government four piastres a year if
he is the owner of a goat, and three for each
sheep he possesses. The collectors of taxes in
almost every instance were Mohammedans; many
of the Christians grumbled at the way they
were assessed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
</p>

<p>
If an Armenian girl expresses a wish to become
a Mohammedan, this gives rise to great jealousy
between the Turks and Christians. At the same
time the Armenians who profess the Armenian
faith detest any member of their community who
has accepted the Roman Catholic or Protestant
doctrines. The Christians being much more
intolerant towards the dissenters from their
respective creeds than the Turks are to the
Christians.
</p>

<p>
There has hardly ever been an instance
of a Turk accepting Christianity, but the
American missionaries in Asia Minor were said
to have converted many Armenians to Protestantism.
</p>

<p>
The Roman Catholic missionaries have not
been idle. A number of Armenians no longer
reverence the Patriarch in Constantinople, but
look upon the Pope as the Head of their
Church.
</p>

<p>
The Turks laugh in their sleeves at the discord
in the ranks of the Christian community.
They cannot understand why so much hatred and
ill-feeling should exist between people who worship
the same Messias.
</p>

<p>
This difference of opinion amongst the Christians
is by no means displeasing to the Turkish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
authorities; it renders any union between the
Armenians and Russia exceedingly difficult.
</p>

<p>
The following morning a servant brought a
paper to my host for his signature. It was a
loyal address from the principal people in Yuzgat
thanking the Sultan for the Constitution. None
of the Armenians believed in the reform. Most
of them held the same opinion as the inhabitants
of Angora, namely, that the projected
Constitution was thrown out as a bait to catch
some of the plenipotentiaries at the Conference,
and that when the Conference was forgotten
the Constitution would be numbered with the
past.
</p>

<p>
Vankovitch now called. I walked with him
to the market which he was constructing for
the townspeople. It was not a large building,
being about eighty yards long by thirty wide;
the houses were each of them two stories high,
built of hewn stone and with glass windows; the
latter a great luxury for the natives, glass having
to be brought all the way from Samsoun, a port
on the Black Sea. The difficulties of transport
were very great, half the glass arrived in a
fractured state, this, and the extreme difficulty
of carriage, added enormously to its cost
price.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In the market there was literally nothing which
would have attracted an observer's attention.
Some of the Armenians sold dye, wood, and goat's
hair; others traded in cotton stuffs and calicos,
one or two American lamps to burn petroleum
were in the window of a small shop which was
kept by a Greek.
</p>

<p>
The engineer had experienced considerable
difficulty in persuading the townspeople to let
him construct a bazaar two stories high. "Our
fathers have always been satisfied with one story,"
remarked the tradesmen, "then why should not
we?"
</p>

<p>
In spite of the opposition, Vankovitch, with
the Caimacan's assistance had managed to carry
the day. The people who had grumbled the
loudest about the new order of things, were the
first to take apartments in the two-storied building.
</p>

<p>
We continued our walk through narrow lanes,
and by the side of tumble-down hovels, till
we arrived on the summit of a hill, the outskirts
of the town. Some good-looking gipsy
women with brown complexions, large dark eyes,
and long black hair, were standing at the door of
one of these habitations.
</p>

<p>
"These are the dancers," said Vankovitch;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
"Dr. Gasparini telegraphed from Angora to ask
me to arrange a gipsy dance for you. Let us
go and talk to one of the old women, and
choose the girls who are to perform."
</p>

<p>
An elderly dame recognized my companion;
she advanced, and invited us to enter her
house. When our errand was known, great
excitement ensued amidst the younger damsels
of the gipsy community. Each one trusted
that her good looks and skill in the Terpsichorean
art would influence my companion in his
choice.
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet!" said the old woman indignantly
to some of the more obstreperous of her young
ladies, who, to show my companion their agility,
were performing a sort of cancan step, very
different from those dances which I had hitherto
seen in the East.
</p>

<p>
"Now, then, Effendi," to my companion, "how
many girls do you require?"
</p>

<p>
"Three."
</p>

<p>
"Well, three you shall have. The most beautiful
and gazelle-like of our tribe. I will come
myself," continued the old lady, "and I too will
dance, if only to show the Frank Effendi what
our dance is like."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was as much as I could do to keep my
countenance; the old woman was very fat; some
of the girls, catching my eye, went off into fits
of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you may laugh, children," said the old
woman indignantly, "but none of you can dance
like I can. They are not supple like I am,
Effendi. They cannot move their hips. They
cannot sway the lower part of their bodies. Look
here!"
</p>

<p>
And straightening her aged limbs, the old
woman commenced wriggling her different joints,
the girls applauding her, and beating time with
their hands to each movement of the dancer's
body.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," said Vankovitch, as she sank
down on a divan, with a force which would have
smashed any less strong piece of furniture.
"Very good. You dance like a stag. You shall
come too."
</p>

<p>
"Thank heavens," he remarked in French, "that
she did not throw herself on to my lap, for this
is the custom of these wild dancers; if she had
done so, there would not have been much left of
me. But come along, let us return; it is very
stuffy here."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After making an appointment with the old
lady for the dancers to come to us on the
following evening, we descended the hill and
walked towards the principal mosque in the
town.

</p>

<p>
On taking off our shoes at the entrance, we
were at once admitted into a large building
constructed in the form of a dome. Two vast
circular halls leading the one into the other, were
beneath the lofty ceiling. Stained glass windows,
with infinitesimally small panes, allowed but
little light to penetrate to the interior, which was
carpeted with rich Persian rugs of many hues and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
fashions. Chains, descending from the centre of
the building, supported a huge circular hoop of
iron. From this were suspended a hundred lamps
of different-coloured crystal. Two enormous wax
candles, each as thick as a man's leg, and about
seven feet high, were fixed in a corner of the
building. They had been made to last a year,
and had cost "tchok para"—a great many
paras.
</p>

<p>
The attendant evidently thought that he should
impress my mind with this announcement, and he
uttered the word "tchok" in a way which no
Englishman could imitate save when he is in
the extreme agonies of sea-sickness. Forty or
fifty Turks were lying on the floor, and seemed to
be in no way disturbed by the entrance of Mr.
Vankovitch and myself.
</p>

<p>
"Are there always as many people here?" I
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"There are very few to-day," was the reply;
"but at whatever hour you may enter, the faithful
will be found praying to the All-powerful One
who rules the Universe."
</p>

<p>
This, indeed, I subsequently discovered to be
the case. No matter how early or late I might
enter a mosque, there were always some men on
their knees, praying to the Almighty; and whenever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
a service was going on, the mosques were
invariably crowded.
</p>

<p>
"They pray more than Europeans do," said
my companion, the engineer, as we quitted the
mosque. "With us," he added, "the women
throng the churches, the men are conspicuous by
their absence; in Turkey you will hardly ever
meet a man who is in the habit of absenting
himself from his mosque. Indeed, a Mohammedan's
superstitious feelings would not allow him
to do so, even if he felt inclined; he would think
that the Divine vengeance would at once pursue
him to his destruction."
</p>

<p>
We now called upon a Turkish gentleman,
Daravish Bey. Presently he left the room, and,
returning, brought an old flint-gun, marked
"London, 1802." He next suggested that we
should join him in a shooting excursion, and, calling
a servant, desired the man to bring in a falcon.
This, Daravish Bey said, would be very useful, as,
if we missed the partridges, the hawk would catch
them for us.
</p>

<p>
"We shall then have some game to show when
we return," he continued, "and the people will not
be able to laugh at our beards."
</p>

<p>
"Vankovitch is a wonderful shot," said another
Turk. "He shoots partridges flying! Only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
think! flying in the air! In the name of heaven,
is it not wonderful? Can you hit a partridge,
except when he is quite still?"
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes," I said; "but, unfortunately,
most of my cartridges are wet; any how, I will try
and find a few dry ones, and will go with you to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"There is another thing which you must see
before you leave Yuzgat," observed Daravish Bey,
"and that is our national game, Djerrid. I have
already spoken about it," he continued; "the
day after to-morrow all the best riders in the
neighbourhood will assemble on the plain outside
the town. In the meantime, I hope that you will
dine with me this evening."
</p>

<p>
"But I am staying with an Armenian gentleman,
and he will expect me to dine at home."
</p>

<p>
"Bring him with you. Nay, do not disappoint
me," he added. "It is many years since
an Englishman has been at Yuzgat, and we
do not know how to honour one sufficiently
when he is here. England and Turkey are
old allies, and God grant that they may remain
so!"
</p>

<p>
I returned to my quarters, and found the Caimacan,
who had come to pay me a visit. He was
very busy, as he had to arrange for some redif
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
soldiers who were to be despatched at once to
Constantinople. After a few compliments and a
cup of coffee, he arose and took his departure.
</p>

<p>
My host now observed,—
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, will you do me a favour?"
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Vankovitch has discharged one of his
under officers, an Armenian. The man is a
friend of mine—will you ask Mr. Vankovitch to
pardon my friend, and reinstate him in his
situation?"
</p>

<p>
"The officer is a thief," said the engineer,
"for that reason I got rid of him. But this
remark of our host will show you what sort of
people these Armenians are. He is well aware
that the fellow is a rogue. He knows that I do
not wish to take him back; to try and make me
do so, he asks you, who are ignorant of the circumstances,
to intercede in the matter."
</p>

<p>
"You will intercede?" said the host.
</p>

<p>
"How can I? Mr. Vankovitch must know the
man's character better than I do."
</p>

<p>
"But Mr. Vankovitch would do it if you asked
him."
</p>

<p>
"I certainly shall not give him the opportunity
of refusing," I replied. And seeing that I was
obdurate, my host left off pressing me for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
moment, but only to return to the attack on the
following day.
</p>

<p>
The next morning, and soon after daybreak, we
assembled for the chase. The engineer had
mounted me on a magnificent coal-black Arab.
He himself rode a little bay, with good shoulders
and fine action; whilst his wife, a Bosnian lady,
who was attired in a light blue riding-habit, a hat
with a peacock's feather, and who wore on her
boot a long cavalry spur—was mounted on a
chestnut.
</p>

<p>
Vankovitch had slung his gun across his
shoulders. His double-breasted shooting-coat
was dotted with cartridge-cases in the Circassian
style. He was an object of great interest to a
crowd of bystanders, and was evidently the
chasseur par excellence of Yuzgat. Some Turkish
women, wrapped up in long white sheets, stared
through the corners of their veils at Mrs.
Vankovitch, and were very much astonished at
the proceedings, for the lady was on a side-saddle,
which the engineer had lately received from Constantinople.
It was only the first or second time
that it had been seen in Yuzgat. The giaour
woman balanced on a peg on the side of the
saddle was a source of considerable wonder to the
assembled crowd.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"How odd these giaours are!" said a Turk to
his neighbour. "Why, even their women go
out hunting! What a thing to ride on! Look,
she has only one foot in the stirrup, and her other
leg is across a peg in the saddle."
</p>

<p>
"How could you sit cross-legged if you had on
that very thin, long dressing-gown which she is
wearing?" said another bystander. "But here
come Daravish Bey and his brother. They are
actually going with the Frank to the chase!"
</p>

<p>
The attention of the crowd was now taken up
by the new arrivals.
</p>

<p>
The two Turkish gentlemen were both dressed
alike in black cloaks lined with fur, and which
descended to their heels. Gold necklaces passing
through diamond rings encircled each man's neck.
Red waistcoats, buttoned up high in front, exposed
to view an inch or two of limp, unstarched
shirt-front; loose black trousers covered their
legs, and a blue and white shabrach their highly-gilded
saddles.
</p>

<p>
An attendant on a pony bore a falcon on his
arm. Some pointers and a greyhound brought
up the rear of the procession. Radford carried
my double-barrelled gun, and a few cartridges,
which on careful inspection seemed not to have
been damaged by the wetting in the river. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
was also a source of wonder to the crowd. It
was whispered about that the gun which he carried
was like the Pole's fire-arm, and that it would
sometimes shoot partridges on the wing.
</p>

<p>
We rode over a mountain, covered with pebbles.
Presently one of the pointers began to
sniff. Vankovitch thought that there was some
game close at hand. He dismounted from his
horse, accompanied by Daravish Bey, who was
armed with the old English flint-gun. A crowd
of men and urchins, who had followed us on foot
from Yuzgat, watched the proceedings with the
greatest interest. Suddenly a covey of partridges
rose about a hundred and fifty yards from the
Pole. Two reports sounded in rapid succession,
the birds flew away untouched. The attendant
released the falcon, and in a few seconds a
partridge was in its claws.
</p>

<p>
A hare broke from behind an adjacent
rock. In a moment we were in headlong pursuit,
the Bosnian lady riding foremost of the
flight, her horse taking the boulders and loose rocks
which strewed the path in a way that showed
he was well accustomed to this style of hunting.
</p>

<p>
A well-known sound made me turn my head.
To my surprise I saw a young Turk galloping
after me on Osman's horse—the roarer. I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
had given orders that the animal was to be left in
the stable, so that he might recover from the effect
of our forced marches the week before.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing with that horse?"
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, I am galloping him," was the quiet
reply. "Osman lent him to me, and said that he
was his property. Have I done wrong in riding
him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said; "take him back at once."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," interrupted Radford, "that is just like
Osman's himpudence, a-lending things which
don't belong to him, and he is not that particular
in returning them either. He is always asking
me to lend him some tobacco, and very little I
ever see of it again, except in the smoke which
comes out of his mouth."
</p>

<p>
"How much are you paying for the forage of
your horses?" now inquired Vankovitch, who
had returned with the hare in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"About seven shillings a day."
</p>

<p>
The Pole began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Seven shillings! Do you know, my dear sir,
that your Turkish servant is robbing you?"
</p>

<p>
"Very likely," I replied. "Most servants
rob their masters. But what is the price of a
horse's forage for a day?"
</p>

<p>
"About one-and-a-half piastres, or at the present
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
rate of exchange about twopence of your
money. And chickens," continued Vankovitch,
"what has he made you pay for them in the
different villages on your route?"
</p>

<p>
"A shilling a piece."
</p>

<p>
"He is a thief," said the Pole, "you have been
awfully cheated! why, the price in the town is
only three halfpence for a fat chicken! When we
return to Yuzgat, send for your man, and let me
ask him a few questions. You shall not be
robbed any more if I can help it. It is a bad
thing for other European travellers, and it gives
the inhabitants a lesson in robbery. There was
a Russian officer here a few years ago. He had
been paying as much as a medjidi a day for each
of his horses. However, he was a Russian, and
it did not so much matter."
</p>

<p>
The following day I went to see the Armenian
schools. In one of them I found 200 girls
who, for Turkey, were receiving a fair education.
Most of them could read and write. A class
for learning embroidery was well attended,
some of the elder girls' work being very neatly
finished. There were two Mohammedan children
in a sewing class. I was informed that many
of the Mussulmans had expressed a wish to send
their children to the school.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you would like to ask the boys some
questions," said a priest who accompanied me
through the building.
</p>

<p>
Now if there is one thing I dislike it is being
turned into an examiner. There is always a
chance of the boys knowing a great deal more
than the amateur setter of questions. But, as
the clergyman pressed me, I tried to remember
some of the sums which I had once learned under
the tuition of my highly esteemed old master Mr.
Marillier of Harrow.
</p>

<p>
The herring and a half sum would have been
too easy; I bethought myself of another.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the priest, a little impatiently,
"they are waiting for you."
</p>

<p>
There was a dead pause, and I gave the worthy
divine the following question: "If one man can
mow a field in three days, and another man in
four, how long will they be doing the work, if they
are both mowing it together?"
</p>

<p>
"Come," said the divine, "you have set them a
very easy sum," and he duly translated it into
Armenian.
</p>

<p>
"It is hardly worth doing," said one of the
schoolmasters, "for of course the answer is three
days and a half."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, three and a half," said the priest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied.
</p>

<p>
The engineer began to laugh, and we soon
afterwards left the school, neither masters nor
pupils being at all certain in their minds as to
how they ought to set about doing the sum.
</p>

<p>
I breathed more freely on arriving in the open
air, and blessed my old master, who had once set
me this catch question, for my reputation as a
profound mathematician is established for ever
amidst this generation of school-boys in Yuzgat.
After saying good-bye to the senior pedagogue
who had accompanied me to the steps of the
threshold, I asked him to give the lads a half-holiday.
He very kindly acceded to my request;
and a cheer from the boys inside, when the good
news was imparted to them, made me aware that
they, if not their masters, were in no way dissatisfied
by my visit.

</p>

<p>
I called upon a Greek who had paid me a visit
on the day of my arrival. Several of his compatriots
were with him. They at once commenced
conversing about what they suffered under
the Turkish administration.
</p>

<p>
"We are very badly treated," said one.
</p>

<p>
"Very badly indeed," said another.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Are the Christians here ever tortured?" I
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever heard of any of them being
impaled?"
</p>

<p>
The company began to laugh.
</p>

<p>
"No such things go on in Turkey," said my
host; "but the law is bad, that is what we mean.
Just before you arrived, we were talking about a
Turk who had borrowed some money from one
of our countrymen and had given a gun as
security for the debt. The Turk died, and the
Christian, not being paid what he was owed, sold
the gun to a friend. Ten years afterwards a son
of the deceased Turk came and claimed the
weapon, which he said was his father's property,
and consequently his own. There were no papers
or witnesses to prove that the gun had been pledged,
and the Cadi decided for the Mohammedan."
</p>

<p>
"If a Turk had been in the Greek's place,
would the same decision have been given?" I
inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was the answer; "the law is equally
bad for Turks and Christians."
</p>

<p>
There is one peculiarity about the Armenians
and Greeks in Yuzgat which attracts the attention
of the traveller, and this is that many of them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
cannot write their own language, although they
employ its characters. Their conversation is almost
invariably in Turkish. In corresponding with a
friend, both Armenians and Greeks will write in
Turkish, but with the Armenian or Greek letters.
The schools, which are encouraged by the Mohammedan
authorities are improving the Christians in
this respect. The present generation of children
can most of them speak, as well as write, in the
language of their ancestors.
</p>

<p>
Later on in the day I mounted my horse, and
accompanied the engineer and his wife to the
outskirts of the town. Here there is a vast
natural basin formed by a circular chain of steep
heights. Yuzgat,<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> which is built on the side of
a hill, and with its houses towering above the
plain looks down upon the enormous arena. An
immense crowd was assembled. Horsemen were
present of all nationalities, and clad in every kind
of costume. Turks, Persians, Armenians, Greeks,
Circassians, Tartars, Kurds, Turkomans, Georgians,
were grouped together in little clusters, and talking
to their fellow-countrymen. Hundreds of
women, clad in long white sheets, had retired
a short distance, and from a slight elevation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
were gazing down upon the assembled multitude.
</p>

<p>
Presently the horsemen divided into two sides.
Each man carried a djerrid or short stick, about
four feet long, not quite so thick as a man's wrist,
and weighted a little at one end. The right hand
of the cavaliers grasped the middle of the djerrid.
The two bands of mounted men, reining their
horses back, halted facing each other, and about
eighty yards apart.
</p>

<p>
Now, at a signal from the leader of one side, a
horseman dashed forward at the opposing band.
Brandishing his djerrid in the air, and shouting
wildly to Allah, he hurled it at one of his opponents.
The latter, who was on his guard, turned
his horse on his haunches, and galloped away in
the same direction as the missile was coming.
Reaching backward, the rider caught the stick, and
was greeted by the applause of the bystanders.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the horseman who had first attacked,
hastened to regain his party. He was pursued in
headlong career by one of the other side, who in
his turn hurled the djerrid. The game requires
considerable skill in horsemanship, and great nerve.
The stick is thrown with all the rider's strength,
augmented by the velocity with which his steed is
galloping. If the missile be not caught or parried,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
but strike a man's body, the effect is often
serious; bones are fractured. Death sometimes
ensues. The horses too have to be highly
trained, so as to be able to halt when at full speed,
and, turning, to start off in a contrary direction.
</p>

<p>
"We rode better in our time," said an old man,
attired in a crimson dressing-gown, and who was
eagerly watching the proceedings, to a companion
by his side; "but what is that which is coming in
this direction?"
</p>

<p>
In the distance a marriage procession could be
seen winding amidst the hills. A bride was being
carried in a cart drawn by oxen to her bridegroom's
house. A band playing discordant music marched
in front. Several women enveloped in sheets of
white muslin rode behind the vehicle. They were
mounted on donkeys, and sat astride them like
men. The position is a curious one, particularly
when the lady wears a short dress.
</p>

<p>
As the procession passed by the crowd, some of
the donkeys began to trot. The motion became
very disagreeable to the fair equestrians. The
robes began to rise, and the husbands running
forward, held down their wives' attire. This
would have provoked the laughter of a European
crowd, but in Turkey women are looked upon
as beings to be shut off from the public gaze.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
The Mohammedan husband as a rule does not
like any one to see him walking with his own
wife. The children too look upon their father as
a being far superior to themselves. The Turkish
parent walks first along the road, the children
next some fifty yards behind their father. Last
of all comes the wife, alone and neglected. She
accepts this lot with resignation—her mother was
a slave before her, and she will remain one till
death or divorce dissolve the marriage-tie.
</p>

<p>
I now called upon the head of the Mohammedan
religion at Yuzgat. He received me very courteously,
and we conversed for some time upon
the respective merits of the Mussulman and Christian
faith. It appeared that very recently a
house belonging to the Imaum (priest) had been
burned to the ground.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you did not lose much property," I
remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Everything I had was burned," said the old
man. "But it did not signify. Allah was kind.
The inhabitants raised a subscription for me.
My house will soon be restored," he continued.
"Allah is very good to all the true believers. If
a house belonging to one of your Christian Mollahs
(priests) be burned down, what does he do?" inquired
the old Mohammedan.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"His house is generally insured," I replied.
"He pays a little money every year to a company,
and then if the edifice is destroyed by fire, it is
built up again for him."
</p>

<p>
"Does he pay much money?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, if the house is a good one, he has to pay
a large sum every year."
</p>

<p>
"What is the good of paying at all?" said
the Mohammedan. "Why does he not trust in
Allah? That is what I have done. My new
house will cost me nothing, God is great,
there is but one God! And Mahomet, he is
the Prophet of God," added the old man
piously.
</p>

<p>
"But I thought that you believed in Kismet—destiny,"
I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Destiny is great, but Allah is greater. He
created destiny," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that Allah can change His mind?"
</p>

<p>
"He is All powerful; he can do what He likes,"
observed the Imaum excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day I walked into an Armenian
church. This was a large building, with red
carpets, and rather reminded me of a mosque.
It must sometimes have been bitterly cold inside,
for there were no stoves in the building. I was
informed that the upper classes who came to pray,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
all wore furs. As the lower orders are not able
to pay for any such warm garments, they must
occasionally be half-frozen when listening to their
priest's oration.
</p>

<p>
A raised platform at one end of the church was
enclosed by trellis-work. It was so constructed
that the occupants of the gallery could see the
clergyman, without their attention being occupied
by the congregation.
</p>

<p>
"This gallery is for our women," said an Armenian,
who showed me over the building; "and the trellis-work
is to prevent them from staring at the men."
</p>

<p>
"Or rather to prevent the men from staring at
them!"
</p>

<p>
My companion laughed at the remark.
</p>

<p>
"It answers both purposes!" he exclaimed.
"But if you look at the screen, you will see that it is
broken in several places, three or four of the holes
in the trellis-partition have been made into one.
The women have done this to obtain a better view."
</p>

<p>
"Do you not separate the women from the men
in your churches?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Then if the ladies are as pretty as they are
said to be, your clergyman must find it rather
difficult to keep the attention of his flock."
</p>

<p>
It was getting dusk. I went straight from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
church to the Pole's house. There was hardly
any furniture in it. This he explained by saying
that he was only temporarily employed at Yuzgat;
so soon as he had finished building the new
bazaar he would have to return to Angora.
A few divans, as in the Turkish houses, surrounded
the walls. The two-barrelled gun,
which sometimes "shot partridges flying," the
wonder of the other sportsmen in Yuzgat, was
lying in a corner.
</p>

<p>
After dinner, which was washed down by some
very fair red wine, manufactured by the Christians
in the town, a little boy, about twelve years
of age, entered the room; coming up to my host,
he whispered something in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"The gipsies have arrived," said Vankovitch,
turning to the lad. He desired him to lay down
some carpets at the other end of the apartment.
</p>

<p>
"That boy does not cost me much," said my
host, pointing to his servant. "I found him
starving in the streets a few years ago, during the
famine. His mother had turned him out of doors.
The child had nothing to eat. I took pity on the
poor little fellow, and he has been with me ever
since; he does more work than all the rest of the
servants together. Whilst, if I wish to punish
him, all I have to do is to point to the door."

</p>

<p>
Some gipsy men now entered, and, squatting
down on the carpet, began to tune their lutes.
One of their party carried a fearful instrument.
It was rather like the bagpipes. He at once commenced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
a wild and discordant blast. The musicians
were followed by the dancers.
</p>

<p>
The chief of the gipsy women was provided
with a tambourine. She was attired in a blue
jacket, underneath this was a purple waistcoat,
slashed with gold embroidery, a pair of very
loose, yellow trousers covered her extremities.
Massive gold earrings had stretched the lobes of her
ears, they reached nearly to the shoulders, and by
way of making herself thoroughly beautiful, and
doing fit honour to the occasion, she had stained
her teeth and finger-nails with some red dye. Her
eyebrows had been made to meet by a line drawn
with a piece of charcoal. Gold spangles were
fastened to her black locks. Massive brass
rings encircled her ankles, the metal jingling as
she walked, or rather waddled round the room.
</p>

<p>
The two girls who accompanied her were in
similar costumes, but without the gold spangles for
their hair, which hung in long tresses below their
waists. The girls, advancing, took the hand of
Vankovitch's wife, and placed it on their heads as
a sort of deferential salute. The Pole poured out
a glass of raki for the fat woman, who, though a
Mohammedan, was not adverse to alcohol. She
smacked her lips loudly; the man with the bagpipes
gave vent to his feelings in a more awful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
sound than before; the lutes struck up in
different keys, and the ball began.
</p>

<p>
The two girls whirled round each other, first
slowly, and then increased their pace till their
long black tresses stood out at right angles from
their bodies. The perspiration poured down their
cheeks. The old lady, who was seated on a divan,
now uncrossed her legs, beating her brass ankle-rings
the one against the other, she added yet
another noise to the din which prevailed. The
girls snapped their castanets, and commenced
wriggling their bodies around each other with
such velocity that it was impossible to recognize
the one from the other. All of a sudden, the
music stopped. The panting dancers threw
themselves down on the laps of the musicians.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of the performance?" said
Vankovitch to me, as he poured out another glass
of raki for the dancers. "It is real hard work, is
it not?" Then, without waiting for an answer,
he continued, "The Mohammedans who read of
European balls, and who have never been out of
Turkey, cannot understand people taking any
pleasure in dancing. What is the good of it when
I can hire some one else to dance for me?" is the
remark.
</p>

<p>
"They are not very wrong," I here observed;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
"that is, if they form an idea of European dances
from their own. Our Lord Chamberlain would
soon put a stop to these sort of performances in
England."
</p>

<p>
"The Lord Chamberlain, who is he?" inquired
an Armenian who was present, and who spoke
French.
</p>

<p>
"He is an official who looks after public
morals."
</p>

<p>
"And do you mean to say that he would object
to this sort of a dance?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"But this is nothing," said Vankovitch. "When
there is a marriage festival in a harem, the women
arrange their costumes so that one article of
attire may fall off after another during the dance.
The performers are finally left in very much
the same garb as our first parents before the fall.
We shall be spared this spectacle, for my wife
is here. The gipsies will respect her presence
because they know that she is a European."
</p>

<p>
Now the girls, calling upon the old woman, insisted
that she too should dance. The raki had
mounted into the old dame's head. Nothing
loath, she acceded to their request; rising to her
feet, she commenced a <i>pas seul</i> in front of the
engineer. First shrugging her shoulders, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
then wriggling from head to toe, as if she were
suffering from St. Vitus's dance, she finally concluded
by kneeling before my hostess, and making
a movement as if she would kiss her feet.
</p>

<p>
The following morning, and just before my
departure, the Pole, who had come to say good-bye
to me, called Osman to his side.
</p>

<p>
"The Effendi is paying two medjidis a day
for his horses," remarked Vankovitch, "and six
piastres for a chicken! Oh! Osman! thou
descendant of a line of thieves! What is the
meaning of this?"
</p>

<p>
The Turk changed colour for a moment; but
then, collecting himself, replied,—
</p>

<p>
"The Effendi's horses are not like other horses,
they eat more, and work more. We and he, too,
we all like large chickens. The Effendi is rich,
and he pays; he is big, and he eats a great deal.
He is not giving more money for barley now than
he gave when he was in Constantinople. The
people at the Khans tell me the price, I give
them what they ask. It would not do for me
to be mean with my lord's gold. In future
I shall know better. I will find out the proper
value of everything, and will only pay what is
just."
</p>

<p>
I interrupted him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Osman," I said, "you are a thief! However,
as we leave Yuzgat to-day, there is no time for me
to get another servant. Only, beware! for if I find
you deceiving me any more, not all the hairs in the
Prophet's beard shall save you from being discharged."
</p>

<p>
"The Effendi knows what is best," said Osman
coolly. "He has brain, and I—I am the dust in
his sight. Another time we will not give so much
for our barley, we will tighten our purse-strings
to the chicken-sellers. We have all been deceived,
we will be so no longer."
</p>

<p>
We rode through an undulating country, in
the direction of Sivas. The track was firm and
good; there was an abundant supply of water
throughout the district, numerous flocks and
herds were grazing by the side of the path.
</p>

<p>
After marching for six hours and a half, we
halted at a Turkoman village, called Kulhurdook,
which contained forty-five mud hovels.
With much difficulty I obtained accommodation
in a filthily dirty barn. Here our horses were
also sheltered; side by side with them stood
several cows and oxen. A small piece of carpet
covered the ground in one corner of the building.
The proprietor, bringing me a pillow, which once
had been white, but was now black with dirt,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
placed it under my head, Radford and Osman
lying down by the side of the horses.
</p>

<p>
There were several mostaphas, or men belonging
to the last army reserve, in this village.
They eagerly inquired if there would be war, but
did not express any wish to fight their country's
battles. This struck me as the more remarkable,
for elsewhere I had observed great martial ardour
amongst the rural classes. I afterwards learnt
that several men who had been enlisted from this
village had been killed in Servia, hence the unwillingness
of the mostaphas to go to what they
considered certain death.
</p>

<p>
I tried to sleep: this was impossible; some
little insects, which the manager of the Crystal
Palace advertises as "industrious," proved their
industry by making fierce onslaughts on my body.
Repeated groans from Osman made me aware
that even his skin was not proof against the
attack; whilst my English servant, who had given
up all idea of sleeping, was walking about with
a pipe in his mouth, and probably doing anything
but bless his master who had brought him
to such an out-of-the-way region.
</p>

<p>
"Can you not sleep, Radford?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep, sir! No! They are running up my
legs like coach 'osses. Hosman's skin is like an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
ironclad, but they give him no peace; they worry
awful, that they do. I have been trying to smoke
them off me, but 'bacca is nothing to these fleas.
We shall be eaten alive if we stay here much
longer—I know we shall!"
</p>

<p>
Having come to much the same conclusion, I
ordered him to saddle the horses, and, to the
astonishment of the proprietor of the hovel,
we left our quarters three hours before daybreak.
</p>

<p>
Presently the country became more mountainous.
It reminded me a good deal of the
Saxon Switzerland, the scenery being very picturesque
as our path wound round some wooded
slopes.
</p>

<p>
We were in a country abounding with pine
forests. The telegraph-wire to Sivas was stretched
not far from our track. Many saw-mills, turned
by the mountain streams, showed where the telegraph-posts
had been made; they had then been
dragged by oxen to their destination.
</p>

<p>
Our road ran through a pleasant valley, and
by the side of a mountain stream known as the
Gogderi Soo. In a few hours we arrived at a
river, called the Tchekar Ermak. It is crossed by
a weak stone bridge, the stream being about thirty
yards wide by four deep. We halted for the night
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
at the village of Tchirklik, a two days' march, or
thirteen hours from Kulhurdook.
</p>

<p>
I was accommodated in a house which actually
possessed two rooms. They were not constructed
in the side of a hill, as the other dwellings in the
neighbourhood, but of wood—one room being
reserved for the proprietor's cattle, sheep, and
camels, the other for himself and harem.
</p>

<p>
I was permitted to sleep in the stable. Osman,
with Radford and our horses, were lodged in a
hovel at the other end of the village.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of the night I awoke with a
feeling of suffocation, my throat was dry and
parched, my eyes began to smart; a crackling
noise overhead could be heard. It gradually
dawned upon me that the house was on fire. I
now discovered that the flames from the fireplace
had ignited some boards in the chimney: they,
in their turn, had set fire to the roof. If the
proprietor, who was sleeping in the next room,
were not immediately aroused, his house would in
all probability be destroyed. The building was
surrounded by a courtyard with high mud walls.
The space outside the dwelling was infested by
dogs. They at once came smelling around me.
</p>

<p>
Shutting the door, to prevent the flames from
bursting out inside, I went to the harem. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
entrance was barred from within. The proprietor
and his wives were fast asleep, they paid
no attention to the noise which I made at the
door.
</p>

<p>
It is of no use standing upon any ceremony
with a man when his house is being burnt down:
drawing my revolver, I fired two shots in the air;
thinking that the sound of the reports would
arouse the sleeping inmates. The effect was instantaneous:
the whole family awoke, the man,
greatly alarmed, thinking that an attack was being
made on the village by a tribe of Kurds; slowly
drawing the bolt, he looked through a crack in
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come!" I said, "your house is on fire!
Be quick, or it will be burned down, and your
camels and oxen be suffocated!"
</p>

<p>
The proprietor bounded out of the room. He
was followed by the harem; the ladies, in the confusion,
did not think of covering their faces, and
were very scantily attired. They ran to a well in
the yard and brought some pitchers of water.
The proprietor by this time had climbed to the
roof of his house. It was a windy night. The
gusts were a source of considerable inconvenience,
to the water-bearers; their hands being occupied
with the pitchers, they could not arrange their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
garments. The latter fluttered above the ladies'
heads, to the great discomfort of the proprietor,
who, much enraged at his house being on fire,
was equally annoyed at his wives' legs being
exposed to the view of an unbeliever.
</p>

<p>
To relieve his mind, I clambered on to the roof.
From this position the ladies' limbs could no
longer be seen. After pouring several buckets
of water on the charred rafters, we managed
to extinguish the flames.

</p>

<p>
It was a bright moonlight night. Not thinking
it likely that we should obtain any more sleep, I
determined to start at once, and take advantage
of the weather. Desiring Radford and Osman,
who had been aroused by the reports of my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
revolver, to saddle the horses, we set off in the
direction of Sileh Zela, a town which contains
3000 houses, and a barracks which will hold at a
pinch 1500 soldiers.
</p>

<p>
Sileh Zela stands in the centre of a natural
basin, the hills which form its sides being at a
distance of six or seven miles from the town. A
small rising ground near the principal street is
occupied by the ruins of an old citadel. A
stream runs through the heart of the city. The
soil in the neighbourhood is very rich; corn
abounds throughout the district. The inhabitants
do not seem to have suffered from the famine
which a few years ago so depopulated the Angora
district.
</p>

<p>
Half a battalion of infantry, about 400 strong,
was drilling in a plain immediately in front of the
town. The inhabitants had turned out, men and
women, to witness the instruction of the troops.
The white dresses of the ladies, contrasting with
the blue uniforms, red caps, and the many-coloured
dresses of the inhabitants, formed a bright and
vivid picture. It was a glorious day. The sun
poured down its rays with a force much more
suggestive of July than January. The drill was
just over as we neared the town. We rode into
Sileh at the head of the regiment, the band,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
which consisted of about twenty musicians, performing
a wild and discordant march. Halting
at the house of the Caimacan, I dismounted and
proceeded to pay him a visit. He was in the
audience-chamber, surrounded by clerks, who were
on their knees, and submitting different documents
for his approval.
</p>

<p>
The great man himself was squatted on a divan;
the members of the town council were by his
side. The Cadi, whose head was enveloped in a
gigantic yellow turban, was engaged in smoking
a long chibouk. A crowd of men were in the
anteroom, some with petitions in their hands,
others apparently prisoners, judging by the guards
who stood beside them.
</p>

<p>
It was evidently a busy day. The Caimacan,
not taking any notice of my arrival, continued
attaching his seal to the different papers.
</p>

<p>
At last he stopped, and, turning to me, salaamed
and apologized for his apparent rudeness. It
appeared that the half battalion which I had seen
drilling was to march the following morning for
Constantinople, <i>viâ</i> Samsoun. The Caimacan was
engaged in making arrangements for its departure.
Carriers would have to be sent forward
to the different villages between Sileh
Zela and Samsoun, to apprise the local authorities
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
of the approaching arrival of the troops. The
chief difficulty which the Caimacan experienced
was the want of money, he presently observed,
"<i>Asker tchok, lakin para yoke</i>," "We have plenty
of soldiers, but no paras" (money).
</p>

<p>
The colonel of the battalion now entered the
room, and after having been introduced to me,
observed that he had heard in the event of
hostilities England would be neutral.
</p>

<p>
"What! desert her old friend of the Crimea?"
said the Caimacan, turning to me. And the
Cadi, grinning in a ghastly manner at the rest of
the company, remarked that England had many
paras, and that perhaps she would send some of
them to the Sultan.
</p>

<p>
This created a revulsion of feeling in my favour—the
assembly having been a little annoyed at
the colonel's statement about the neutrality of
Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
"Well," I said, "you will probably have an
ally in Austria."
</p>

<p>
"An ally in Austria!" said the colonel; "no,
certainly not. There are more Slavs than Magyars
in the Emperor Francis Joseph's dominions.
However, Andrassy, a Hungarian, is at
the head of affairs, and by all accounts he rules
the emperor. Perhaps Andrassy may prevent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
Austria from allying herself with Russia against
us."
</p>

<p>
"We shall have to fight our own battles this
time," continued the colonel; "and, please God,
we will win."
</p>

<p>
An old Imaum, who was seated in a corner,
now put in a word, and said that if there were a
war, he too would go at the head of the Imaums.
I had observed this same propensity for fighting
amidst other Mohammedan priests. In fact in
Asia as in Europe the most bellicose members of
society are often those gentlemen whose profession
is that of peace.<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a>
</p>

<p>
"We shall have Yakoob Khan of Kashgar with
us," observed the Caimacan.
</p>

<p>
"No we shall not," replied the colonel; "the
Russians have stirred up a quarrel between
Yakoob and the Chinese, so as to prevent him
giving us any assistance."
</p>

<p>
"Will any other Mohammedan states help
you?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all of them will fight for Islam."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Russia is large," continued the officer, "but
she will have to divide her forces. She will
have to be on her guard against the Khivans,
Bokharians, and Turkomans in Asia, she must
also protect herself against a rising of the Poles
in Europe."
</p>

<p>
The Caimacan, now rising from the divan, walked
with me to a small house in the neighbourhood
which was reserved for the use of travellers.
</p>

<p>
There were very few Armenians in Sileh, the
population being made up almost entirely of the
followers of the Prophet. The ancient city is
nearly a mile from the present site, and tradition
tells us that it was built upon the so-called mound
of Semiramis. I found the castle in a very
dilapidated state, the wall round it bore signs of
having been constructed from the ruins of some
very ancient edifice; here and there were heavy
blocks of marble and other broken débris which
had been let into the sides of the enclosure.
</p>

<p>
According to the inhabitants, there is a secret
passage leading from the citadel to a small square
several hundred yards below the hill; this is
very likely the case, for although now a third-rate
town, Sileh was once a city of considerable
military importance.
</p>

<p>
Whilst I was looking at the antiquities, Osman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
had been engaged in buying some tea and sugar,
the supply which I had brought from Constantinople
being almost entirely exhausted, the tea
and sugar having gone more rapidly than the other
provisions. On my remarking this to Radford,
I was informed that Osman had a sweet tooth,
and had declared that tea was good for his
stomach.
</p>

<p>
I called the Turk to my side.
</p>

<p>
"Osman," I said, "you have nearly finished my
tea and sugar. What is the meaning of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, I like tea, I like sugar; but what I
like most of all is to hear my lord's liberality
praised. Whenever I am drinking tea, and the
village people see me putting much sugar in my
glass, they honour me. In this manner they
honour my lord."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to be honoured in some other
way for the future," I observed; "and Radford
tells me that you are always praying instead of
saddling the baggage-horses."
</p>

<p>
"Quite true, sir," remarked Radford, who
gathered from my gestures what the conversation
was about. "Quite true; he has worn off the
nap of my new great coat a-praying on it.
He is always on his knees whenever there is some
work to do."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Now for the future, Osman," I continued,
"should I give orders to commence loading the
animals at daybreak, you must get up two hours
before sunrise: there will be then ample time for
your devotions. In the meantime, when you
pray, you are to kneel on your own jacket, and
not on Radford's."
</p>

<p>
"Is my brother angry?" said the Turk, pointing
to his fellow-servant.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will not offend him any more."
</p>

<p>
And shaking hands with the Englishman,
Osman manifested his friendship by borrowing
a little tobacco.
</p>

<p>
On leaving Sileh Zela we rode by numerous
gardens, planted with all kinds of fruit-trees, and
enclosed by high walls built for the most part of
dried mud. The road then continued through a
series of vast circular basins, each from six to seven
miles in diameter, and similar to the one which
surrounded the town. The walls of these basins
were formed of many coloured sand-hills. The
plains below were sowed with every kind of grain.
</p>

<p>
We passed Tartars on their way to Sileh
Zela, the women walking along the road, and the
lazy husbands on horseback, riding in front of
their wives.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Turkoman and Circassian villages abound
throughout this district. The inhabitants were
eager to hear about the war. When the Russians
drove the Circassians from the Caucasus, the Sultan
gave the exiles land in Anatolia. The wild
mountaineers thirst for the opportunity of revenging
themselves upon the Muscovites.
</p>

<p>
We left the corn-growing country behind us,
and emerged upon a plain thickly planted with
tobacco. On one side of the track, the mountains
were covered with vines, on the other were
many-coloured sand-hills.
</p>

<p>
Presently a wonderful phenomenon presented
itself to us. A thick, black cloud, which all the
morning had hung above a mountain-top, burst
over our heads, and then being gradually wafted onward,
it poured down its waters on the sand-hills.
The sun, which was shining brightly, formed a
magnificent rainbow—the glorious orb joined
earth to sky, its matchless colouring lit up the
whole of the firmament.
</p>

<p>
The waters dashed down the sides of the hills.
The torrent bore with it a million particles of
coloured sand. In a moment the rivulets at our
feet ran white, red, and then crimson. The
thunder roared in the distance. A flash of
lightning streaked the horizon with gold.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting ere we reached our halting-place,
and as we rode up the main street of the
village of Bazar, our horses had to wade through
about three feet of water—the result of the recent
storm. I obtained quarters for the night in a
small, but clean wooden house belonging to a
Turkish gentleman. He was formerly an officer
in the army, and had been employed at Kars
during the siege.
</p>

<p>
"Pacha Williams proved himself to be a great
man," observed my host. "He was always busy,
and not like other Pachas, who spend their lives
in the harem. He went out at all hours of the
night to inspect the fortifications. There was
another Englishman with him—a young man of
fair complexion, but with a heart like a lion."
</p>

<p>
"Teesdale?" I observed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that was his name. The hearts of our
poor Osmanlis were cheered when they saw this
young Englishman sharing all their privations,
never grumbling, and always cheerful. If the
war breaks out again, God grant that you may
send us many more such officers! Is Pacha
Williams still alive?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Is he a very great man in your country?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"You English are a wonderful nation," continued
my host. "You reward the Pachas who
are brave and skilful. In our country if a captain
has a relation in the harem of the grand vizier,
the officer is sure to rise to high command; but
with you a man must have merit to succeed."

</p>

<p>
It is only a few hours' march from Bazar to
Tokat, the track running parallel to the river of
the same name. There are many villages by the
side of the stream. The valley widens, and then
narrows again as we proceed towards the town.
Tokat at last lies before us. It is a long,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
straggling city, and on the left bank of the
river.
</p>

<p>
We were met by a Zaptieh. He conducted me
to a house set apart for travellers. Shortly afterwards
I received a visit from the Caimacan (governor).
This official was an active, bustling little
man, and much more energetic than any of the
governors I had previously met.
</p>

<p>
An order had arrived for him to send 1000 men
immediately to Samsoun. The battalion would
march the following morning at daybreak. He
proposed that I should go and see the start.
</p>

<p>
An engineer now called, a Pole by birth, but a
naturalized Englishman. He was engaged in
making a road from Tokat to Sivas; he had been
in Tokat five years, and the work was not half
completed. Indeed, judging by the system
adopted for the construction of public works in
Anatolia, it will be a wonder if the road is ever
finished.
</p>

<p>
According to the engineer, Tokat has a population
of 25,000 inhabitants. Of these there are
8000 men who should each work four days a year
at the construction of the road.
</p>

<p>
"It is a pitiable sight," continued the Pole.
"The Zaptiehs are ordered to bring the people. A
rich inhabitant bribes the gendarmes; they leave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
him and seize some impecunious individual. The
latter is brought to me, and I tell the fellow to
commence digging. The man digs so long as I am
in sight, but the moment my back is turned, down
goes the shovel, and he lights a cigarette. The
result is that I have been here five years, and only
five miles of road are finished."
</p>

<p>
The engineer complained of the want of funds
in the public chest. His pay was only 10<i>l.</i> per
month, and it was never paid punctually. Meantime,
the authorities had discharged several
engineers in their employ, on the ground that
every piastre in the treasury was required for
the maintenance of the troops.
</p>

<p>
There were several Armenian schools in Tokat,
and the Turks and Christians got on very well
together. However, the Caimacan was of opinion
that not much reliance could be placed upon the
Greeks, i. e. in the event of a war between Turkey
and Russia.
</p>

<p>
"They are very cunning," remarked the governor.
"They will not declare themselves at
once, but will wait a little, and hang back to see
which side is the strongest. They still dream of
the old Greek Empire, and think that some day
Constantinople will be a Greek capital. This is
not very likely to happen," he continued. "If
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
Russia were to conquer us, and to take Constantinople,
she would not be willing to hand it over to
the Greeks. What Russia takes she keeps. Look
at the Caucasus. Look at the Crimea. Look at
Khiva, Tashkent, and Samarcand. Some day she
will try and conquer India, and what shall you do
then?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably take our Indian troops, and, joining
with the Afghans, and inhabitants of Kashgar,
drive Russia out of Central Asia," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"That is easier said than done," said the governor.
"But, talking of the natives of India, is it
true, as I have read in our newspapers, that
many Mussulmans in India have petitioned your
Queen to help the Sultan?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I replied, "I believe so."
</p>

<p>
"Then why does she not oblige them? Your
interests are bound up with our interests. We do
not wish to lose Constantinople. It would be our
death-blow. It would be your death-blow if
the Black Sea belonged solely to Russia, for her
ships could remain there in perfect safety, and,
running out at any moment, might attack your
commerce in the Mediterranean."
</p>

<p>
"There are a great many old soldiers in Tokat,"
observed the engineer, "men who fought in the
Crimea. They have asked me if there is any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
chance of England joining Turkey, and are
longing to serve, with English pay and English
rations."
</p>

<p>
"The men who leave to-morrow go without any
pay," said the Caimacan, "but they march cheerfully.
We shall have to fight it out to the end," he
continued; "if Russia does not destroy Turkey,
Turkey must destroy Russia! I will sell my
watch and everything I have in the world to raise
funds for the war. We must all do the same."
</p>

<p>
Whilst we were conversing an order arrived for
the Caimacan to supply all the Armenians and
Greeks in Tokat with firearms, and have them
instructed in drill.
</p>

<p>
"I must go," he observed, and, rising from the
divan, he left me alone with the engineer.
</p>

<p>
"He is a most energetic man," said the Pole,
pointing to the retreating figure of the Caimacan.
"If Turkey had more governors like him, she
would not be reduced to her present straits. The
great mistake in this country is the continual
change of Caimacans. When we have a good
governor, we never keep him for more than six
months; the present man has been here about that
time, he does not rob the people, and is thoroughly
honest: we shall probably soon lose him."
</p>

<p>
Several of the principal persons in the town
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
now came to call upon me; amongst others, a
certain Osman Bey, a Circassian, and the chief of
a large band which had emigrated from the Caucasus
a few years previous. He was dressed in
the Circassian style, with a sheep-skin coat,
tightly buckled round his waist, embroidered
leather trousers and high boots; a black Astrakhan
cap surmounted his bronzed features. He was a
fine tall fellow, and immensely popular with the
inhabitants of Tokat.
</p>

<p>
After conversing for a little while about my journey,
and the state of the roads between Tokat and
Erzeroum, he proposed that I should accompany
him to his house, drink tea there, and be introduced
to his relatives. The engineer came with us.
After walking through some lanes, where the mud
reached considerably above my ankles, we arrived
before a square-built, whitewashed house. A
solid wooden door, absolutely possessing a knocker—an
article of luxury not known in Tokat, save
to the richer inhabitants, gave admission to a
small courtyard. This, in its turn, led to the
apartments reserved for Osman Bey and the
members of his family.
</p>

<p>
He had sent a servant on before, to say that he
was on his way. About fifteen Circassian gentlemen
were seated around the room.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"We Circassians have heard a great deal of
your nation," said Osman Bey, as he motioned to
me to take a seat. "We once thought that England
was going to help us to drive the Russians out of
our country. However, you did not come; they
outnumbered us, and they had artillery opposed
to our flint guns. What could we do? We resisted
as long as possible, and then, sooner than
be slaves, came here."
</p>

<p>
"If there is a war, shall you all go to the front?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, every able-bodied man amongst us. We
do not pay any taxes to the Sultan; he gave us
our land, and we owe him a debt of gratitude.
Not only that," continued the speaker, and at the
same time drawing a long, keen knife from his
sash, and flipping his nail against the blade, "but
we shall have an opportunity of cutting a few
Muscovite throats!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope you will not kill the women and children!"
I observed. "Nobody cares about the
men; but in Europe we have a horror of people
who massacre women and children."
</p>

<p>
"We shall do as the Russians do, and as they
have always done," observed my host grimly.
"They have killed our old men, have cut to
pieces pregnant women, and have tossed the children
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
on the bayonets, whilst the soldiers have
satisfied their lust upon our wives, and burnt
them to death afterwards!<a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a> Well, if they do the
same thing now, we shall follow the example
set us, and shall continue doing so, until England
or some other power interferes to save our
countrymen from the devilish tyranny of these
Muscovite butchers. Let me give you one instance
of their cruelty. A few years ago the Russian
authorities informed the Circassians that whoever
wished might leave the Imperial dominions and go
elsewhere. This was probably done to discover
what natives were well disposed or otherwise to the
Russian rule. There was no real intention on the
part of the Government to allow any of its subjects
to pass the frontier. Seven hundred families
belonging to some villages near the town of
Labinsky, thought that it was a <i>bonâ fide</i> permission.
Leaving their district, they started for the
Turkish frontier. A short time afterwards they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
were surrounded by Russian troops, cavalry and
artillery, and ordered to return. The fugitives
said that they had permission to leave Russia.
The officer in command insisted that they
should at once retrace their steps. The command
was not immediately obeyed, the troops
fired at the villagers, and then charged them
with the bayonet; only thirteen Mohammedans
survived to tell the tale. All the rest,
men, women, and children at the breast, were cut
to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"Are these assertions really true?" I said to
another Circassian.
</p>

<p>
"We know it, to our cost," he replied. "This
is only one instance which Osman Bey has
just given you, and which you have written down
in your note-book; but there are many more
equally horrible. The Russians have made a hell
of our beautiful country. They are worse than
the fiend himself."
</p>

<p>
"Do your country-people like the Russians?"
said Osman Bey.
</p>

<p>
"Some do," I replied; "but they do not believe
in these horrible cruelties which you have been
just relating to me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, tell them to travel through our
country—that is, if the Russians will let them—to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
go to our villages and talk to the country people;
but not in the presence of Russians, as the poor
sufferers would be afraid to speak, knowing well
the fate which would await them when their questioners
had departed. Let any of the people of
England, who now sympathize with Russia, do
this, and then let them form an opinion about the
merits of the case."
</p>

<p>
"When you return to your own country will
you publish what I have said to you?" said Osman
Bey.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I said, "every line. Listen to what I
have written, so that there may be no error."
</p>

<p>
And I translated to him my notes, the engineer
aiding me in the task.
</p>

<p>
"Are all your countrymen of one mind in their
hatred of the Russians?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Unfortunately, no," said Osman Bey. "The
authorities have been clever enough to sow the
seeds of dissension amongst our ranks. For example,
they will often give the post of 'stanishna'
(a local authority) in the different villages to a
Circassian of a low degree. This gives him authority
over our nobles. Ill-feeling is thus created
between the two classes; it is utilized by the
Russians."
</p>

<p>
"One of our number is doing his best to avenge
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
himself on the Muscovites," said another of the
party, a good-looking young fellow, apparently
about twenty years old, and Osman Bey's nephew.
"His name is Yonn Bek; he has taken up his
abode in the Farsa Shaguash mountain near Ekaterinograd,
and kills the Russians whenever he can
meet them. He has been pursued; but he has
depôts in the mountain where he keeps provisions,
and the Russians have never been able to trace
him to his lair. The authorities have offered Yonn
Bek a great many gold imperials if he would leave
the country, as the man has done so much mischief
there; but Yonn declines, and says that if the Russians
have not been able to capture him in eight
years, and he has been able to do them so much
damage, what will not happen to the foe when the
war breaks out and he is joined by other men
like himself?"

</p>

<p>
The following morning the servant of the house in
which I was lodging entered the room and observed
that a Zaptieh corporal, or Onbashee, who had
escorted us into the town on the day of my arrival,
wished to see me.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him to come in," I said. In a few
minutes the Onbashee opened the door; approaching
me, he took from his waistcoat five
piastres, and placed them in the palm of his hand.
</p>

<p>
"What is this for?" I inquired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Osman!" answered the Onbashee, with a
sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Osman! What has he been doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Osman gave them to me, Effendi; but you
said that he was to give me half a medjidi—he
has kept the difference for himself!"
</p>

<p>
It now flashed across my mind that the previous
evening I had desired Osman to give the corporal
half a medjidi as a baksheesh, and that I had told
him to do so in the presence of the servant of the
house. The latter had informed the Onbashee.
Osman, who wished to appropriate to himself the
difference between five piastres and the larger coin,
was thus detected.
</p>

<p>
I sent for the culprit. He was aware that his
knavery had been discovered. Instead of coming
to me with his usual assertion that he was the
most industrious man in the world, he stood in the
corner of the room, an object of derision to the
Onbashee, who was regretting the loss of his half
medjidi, and to the servant of the house, who had
been the means of disclosing Osman's dishonesty.
</p>

<p>
Addressing the guilty man, I asked him why he
had not given the Zaptieh the half medjidi, and
added that the previous evening, when he had told
me of the expenses of the day, he had charged me
with that sum.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Osman had hardly anything to say for himself.
Presently he stammered out something about his
only having five piastres in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"That is a lie, Effendi!" here interrupted the
Onbashee. "He had many coins in his hand when
he gave me the five piastres."
</p>

<p>
I at once made up my mind to get rid of
Osman. Vankovitch's remarks about the Turk's
dishonesty also recurred to my memory. Osman
was undoubtedly a rogue; I determined to procure
another servant.
</p>

<p>
"Osman," I said, "you have robbed a
Mohammedan, a follower of Islam, and one of your
own religion. If you had confined yourself to
robbing me, I could have understood it, for you
might have reasoned to yourself as follows: 'The
Effendi is a giaour, and there is gold in his purse.'
But to rob a brother Mohammedan, and a poor man;
to rob him of the pittance which I had given him,—this
I can only understand by the assumption that
you are a greater scoundrel than I thought you
were! You are no longer my servant. You
darken the threshold no longer!"
</p>

<p>
"I am innocent, Effendi!" cried Osman.
</p>

<p>
"Well, prove your innocence, and I will say no
more about the matter."
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, the Onbashee is a liar!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Very likely, but then the servant must be a
liar as well, and he saw you give the five piastres
to the corporal. Now what interest has the
servant in telling a lie about the matter?"
</p>

<p>
This was too much for the delinquent; lowering
his eyes, he walked out of the room, through a
long row of servants, who had come from the
neighbouring houses to hear me administer justice.
</p>

<p>
The sentence appeared to give great satisfaction
to the Onbashee.
</p>

<p>
"May I put Osman in prison?" he eagerly inquired.
</p>

<p>
"I have no authority on such matters," I
replied.
</p>

<p>
"No, Effendi, but the Caimacan likes you, and
if you asked him to do so, he would put Osman in
prison. Just a day or so, Effendi! Please do!"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you want to put him in gaol?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because, if he is once shut up, we will not let
him out till he has returned me the difference
between your present and the five piastres."
</p>

<p>
"No," I said; "here is the difference," at the
same time giving him a small sum of money.
"But now go and inquire in the town for a man
who wants a situation, as I want a servant
immediately."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Just then a sergeant entered the room. He
brought word from the Caimacan that he was
waiting for me, and that the battalion would leave
Tokat in about half an hour.
</p>

<p>
I at once rode to the barracks. They consisted
of two old Khans, which surrounded a courtyard,
the Khans being used as barracks when there were
troops in Tokat, and at other times of the year
as lodgings for wayfarers. The streets leading to
the Khans were lined with women, muffled up in
long white sheets, and weeping piteously. The
battalion was drawn up in two ranks inside the
courtyard. The men were standing at ease, and
engaged in talking to their numerous friends
and relatives. Immense enthusiasm prevailed
amidst the bystanders. Numbers of volunteers
were offering their services.
</p>

<p>
"Look at these men, sir," observed Radford,
who was riding behind me; "they do not look as
if they liked going as soldiers: bless my heart
alive, if they ain't a-crying!"
</p>

<p>
I glanced in the direction he was pointing, and
saw thirty or forty men with most woe-begone
faces, and some of them in tears.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you crying?" I said to one of their
party. "Are you afraid of being killed?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Effendi, we want to go with our brothers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
in the battalion and to fight by their side; but
the major will not take us, he says that his
battalion is complete. Do ask him to let us
accompany him! Our hearts are full of sorrow
at being left behind."
</p>

<p>
A captain in the regiment, a short, podgy-looking
man, with very fat cheeks, now came to
them, and tried to console the volunteers by saying
that their turn would come soon, and that
they should go with the next battalion.
</p>

<p>
It was a curious spectacle: the soldiers dressed
in a neat dark blue serge uniform, and with their
feet in sandals, surrounded by little knots of
relatives clad in every kind of attire that can well
be imagined; fathers embracing sons, brothers
rubbing cheeks with brothers, and the sergeant
and corporals vainly endeavouring to get their
men into some sort of order; the fat captain in
the background engaged in trying to console the
rejected volunteers; and the younger portion of
the crowd looking inquisitively at the new Martini-Peabody
rifles which had only arrived from
Samsoun the previous evening. Some of the
soldiery were showing how quick their rifles could
be loaded and fired. The rapidity of the system
created great astonishment amidst the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"The giaours come from the country where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
these guns are made," said a bystander, pointing
to Radford and myself.
</p>

<p>
"The giaours have more brain than we have,"
said another.
</p>

<p>
"If they help us, we shall eat the Russians!"
exclaimed a third. We became the object of
still more curiosity when a sergeant, coming to
me, said that the Caimacan was in the major's
room, drinking coffee, and hoped that I would
join him there.
</p>

<p>
"He is going to drink coffee with the Governor—he
is a great man!" said one of the bystanders.
Some of the volunteers, rushing up, entreated
me to intercede with the Caimacan, and perhaps
he could induce the major of the battalion to take
them with him to the war.
</p>

<p>
The major, and several other officers were
squatted on a carpet in a small and rather dirty
room overlooking the courtyard. The Caimacan
was seated on a chair, a dervish sat by his side.
The latter individual was a portly-looking man,
wrapped up in a roll of brown cloth, and with a
gigantic sugar-loaf hat on his head. The hat was
made of grey cloth, and would have made the fortune
of the leader of a nigger band. Several more
officers now came into the room, amongst others
the fat captain. They each in turn bent before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
the dervish, who placed his hands above their
heads, and pronounced some sort of a blessing.
</p>

<p>
A Circassian entered the building. He presently
informed us that five thousand of his
nation, who resided in the neighbourhood of
Tokat, had expressed a wish to go to the seat of
war, and to bring with them their own horses and
arms.
</p>

<p>
By this time the sergeants had succeeded in
arranging their men in the ranks, and the major
going downstairs, followed by the Imaum or chaplain
of the regiment, the latter addressed the
battalion. The Imaum was attired in a lieutenant's
uniform, but with a green turban round
the fez, as a distinctive mark of his profession.
</p>

<p>
The Chaplain's discourse was not a long one. It
was listened to with great attention by the populace.
When he had finished the ranks were again
broken by a crowd of eager, excited Mussulmans,
who rushed up to embrace their friends.
</p>

<p>
As I was descending the steps, my attention was
called to a man who was seated on the stair. He
was sobbing like a child; at the same time striking
his chest with the palms of his hands.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
On his looking up, I recognized the muleteer
whom I had hired to bring my baggage from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
Sileh Zela to Tokat. The man on seeing me
sprang to his feet, then throwing himself on the
ground, he began to embrace my legs, at the same
time kissing my boots.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that several baggage animals were
required for the battalion which was about to
march. The Zaptiehs of Tokat had pressed the
muleteer into their service, and had taken his
mules.
</p>

<p>
"Do speak for me, Effendi!" he said. "They
will take me to Kars. I shall be a ruined man.
And my wife expects me home—she is in a
delicate state of health; I shall shortly be a
father."
</p>

<p>
"It is useless," said the Caimacan, who overheard
his prayers. "We must have baggage
animals," he continued; "you will not be taken
to Kars, only to Samsoun; you will be paid for
the hire of your animals. Dry your eyes, and do
not block up the steps."
</p>

<p>
"It is a great pity, and I am very sorry for
these poor fellows," observed the Caimacan, turning
to me; "but what can we do? It is war time,
or very soon will be so: some of us must suffer."
</p>

<p>
"Listen to those poor women there," he continued,
as we rode through the gate, preceded by
the brass band of the regiment playing a melancholy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
march. A deep wail could be heard even
above the noise of the instruments. The wives,
mothers, and other female relatives of the soldiers,
had not been permitted to enter the barracks;
but from an early hour they had taken up a
position along the streets. The bitter cry, which
was joined in by hundreds of voices, announced
to the people in the very outskirts of the town
that the battalion was on the march.
</p>

<p>
Presently the band ceased playing; and the
old major, his long white beard streaming in the
wind, began singing the words: "God is great.
There is but one God, the God, and there is but
one Prophet, the Prophet, and he is the Prophet
of God."
</p>

<p>
The soldiers took up the strain, ten thousand
bystanders joined in the verse—it even silenced
the women's wail—and resounded along the
banks of the river. Here taken up by some
people on the ruined citadel, the words were
re-echoed back to us; there wafted by the breeze
to an adjacent hamlet, the peasantry swelled the
chorus. The standard of the battalion, with the
crescent embroidered on a green border, was
raised high in the air, and several of the crowd,
rushing up to the major, implored him to take
them in his ranks.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was a striking scene—these weeping women
in their shroud-like dresses; the many-coloured
garments of the men; the excited soldiery—the
still more excited major; and the immense religious
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Snow-capped mountains barred the way before
us, and the river, its banks set fast with ice and
hoar-frost, glittered in the distance, and reflected
the rays of a midday sun.
</p>

<p>
Large stacks of wood had been piled up near
the stream. The timber had been cut in the
forests above the town, and been floated down
the river to Tokat. It is chiefly used for smelting
copper, the Government having some smelting
works in the neighbourhood. According to
my informant, they were established thirty years
ago by a German; after his decease they had
been bought by the Turkish authorities.
</p>

<p>
The Caimacan thought that he had accompanied
the battalion far enough. Drawing a
little on one side, we let the soldiers pass us.
The standard-bearer waved his flag, the old
major saluted by lowering the point of his sword
as he rode past, and with the words, "Go in
safety, God be with you. We shall meet in Erzeroum,"
we parted.

Captain—An Armenian doctor—Business
is flat—The Christian population to be armed—Visitors
asking favours—Your reward will be in heaven—A

</p>

<p>
Soon afterwards I met Osman Bey, my acquaintance
of the previous day. He was on the
point of leaving for a Circassian hamlet in the
neighbourhood. It appeared that a feud had
arisen between the people of this village and
another one in its vicinity; the Bey was going
there to calm, if possible, the angry feelings of
the inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
He remarked that in the event of war breaking
out between Turkey and Russia he should go to
the Caucasus.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Will there be a great rising in that country?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"It is very doubtful," was the answer; "our
people have risen several times;<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> no foreign power
has assisted us, and the result is that we have
been decimated by our enemy. My countrymen
are afraid of doing anything, unless they
feel certain that they will be aided in their
attempt. If England were to help us," he continued,
"and could only capture one Russian
port on the Black Sea, the Circassians would
have confidence, and there would be a rising
throughout the length and breadth of our
land."
</p>

<p>
On returning to my house I found the Zaptieh
who had been defrauded by my late servant. He
was awaiting me with a candidate for Osman's
place.
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, I have brought you a wonderful
fellow," said the gendarme; "if you send him
with a message, he will fly; he will guard your
purse more carefully than his own."
</p>

<p>
It appeared that the wonderful man's name was
Mohammed; he was a redif soldier. His battalion
would march in the course of a week or so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
to Erzeroum. To avoid going with the troops he
proposed that he should engage himself as my
servant until we reached that town, and then he
could join his battalion.
</p>

<p>
"But will your commanding officer give you
leave to accompany me?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"If the Effendi asks him," interrupted the
Zaptieh.
</p>

<p>
Mohammed was apparently not above twenty-five
years of age. He had a pleasant, frank
expression, and I determined to engage him,
that is, if I could obtain the sanction of his
captain.
</p>

<p>
I now went to see this officer. He at once
agreed to the proposal; that is, if I would pledge
myself to give up Mohammed at Erzeroum.
</p>

<p>
"How can I pledge myself?" I remarked, "he
may run away on the road."
</p>

<p>
"That is true," said the officer; "but he is a
straightforward fellow—he will not do so. If I
had the power, I would let you take him as a
servant for all the time that you remain in the
country; but I have no authority to do this, I
am merely a captain."
</p>

<p>
The matter was settled. Returning to my house,
I informed the man of his officer's consent.
</p>

<p>
Mohammed was to have the same wages as Osman,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
and as he had a horse of his own, which he
wished to take to Erzeroum, I was to pay for the
forage of the animal, and could make use of him
for the baggage. This would be very useful;
hitherto I had been obliged to hire a horse, owing
to my loss of Obadiah. Up to this time I had been
travelling on the postal track. It was possible
to find horses. After leaving Sivas, the next
town I should reach, there would be no more
postal-stations; I should then have to trust to my
being able to hire animals from the peasantry, or
be obliged to purchase another horse.
</p>

<p>
"I have a wife," said Mohammed; "will my
lord give me a little money?"
</p>

<p>
"How much do you want?"
</p>

<p>
"Two liras."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if he will bolt with the money, like
the Tartar I engaged last winter in Orenburg."
This idea at once occurred to my mind. On
second thoughts, I remembered that he was
well known to the Zaptieh, and to many of the
other inhabitants of Tokat; so I acceded to his
request.
</p>

<p>
An Armenian doctor called to see me. He
had been educated in the States, and spoke
English with a most unmistakable Yankee drawl.
</p>

<p>
"How is business here?" I inquired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Very flat," said the medical gentleman; "the
people do not put much faith in doctors, that is,
until they are really ill, and then we have a busy
time of it. They pill themselves," he continued,
"and go in for herbs and old women's remedies;
they get them cheap, and grudge the money which
they must pay to a regular practitioner."
</p>

<p>
"You do not look very well," said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, there is not much the matter," I
replied. The fact was that I had a splitting headache,
owing to the charcoal pan or mungo which
warmed the apartment. The gas from the charcoal
being lighter than the air, fills the upper part of the
room. The Turks and Armenians generally squat
on the floor. They do not feel the effects of the
fumes so much as a person who is seated on the
divan.
</p>

<p>
Another Armenian now paid me a visit. He
was the telegraph inspector in Tokat, and he informed
us that orders had just been sent from
Constantinople to buy up all the available horses
in this neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
"Things look warlike," he continued, "and the
doctor," pointing to his compatriot, "will have
plenty of practice before long. The whole Christian
population is to be armed. It is clear that
the Government has not much faith in the Conference,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
and is doing its best to prepare for
war."
</p>

<p>
The Armenians in Tokat complained of the slack
way in which justice was administered throughout
that district. According to the doctor, if a man
committed a crime, and could get away for a year
or two and then return to his home, he would not
be pursued by the authorities; that is, unless the
aggrieved parties made a formal complaint.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said another visitor, "three months ago
fifty-four malefactors escaped from the prison.
Forty of them shortly afterwards surrendered; the
rest made their way to the mountains. Their
ringleader, who is a murderer, has been recently
seen in Tokat: no one has cared to arrest him."
</p>

<p>
Four young Turks entered the room; the
eldest could not have been more than three-and-twenty.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"We do not wish to go to the war," replied one
of them, who took upon himself to be spokesman
for the party.
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Because we are married men and have children."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot help you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Effendi, you can; you might speak to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
the Caimacan, and he could free us from military
service."
</p>

<p>
"His duty is to send you to the front," observed
the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but he evidently likes the Frank, for we
saw them riding together, and if the Effendi would
only ask him, he could not be so inhospitable as
to decline."
</p>

<p>
I was a little annoyed at this remark, and
observed,—
</p>

<p>
"I certainly shall not ask for anything of the
kind. Other people who have wives and children
are obliged to go, then why not you?"
</p>

<p>
"But they did not love their wives so much as
we love ours," persisted the man.
</p>

<p>
The Caimacan now called. Upon his arrival
the four visitors, after grovelling almost in the
dust before him, took their departure.
</p>

<p>
"What did they want?" said the Governor.
</p>

<p>
I told him.
</p>

<p>
"It is very unpatriotic of them," he observed.
"The cunning little dogs, to ask you to intercede
on their behalf! But they shall all go with the
next battalion!"
</p>

<p>
I was evidently destined to have a succession of
visitors on that afternoon, for no sooner had the
Caimacan gone than another official arrived. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
at once commenced a conversation by saying that
he had been employed in collecting the redif
soldiery from the different villages in the neighbourhood,
and had also started a subscription
amongst the wealthier inhabitants to provide the
men with warm shirts.
</p>

<p>
"You have acted very kindly, and doubtless
with the best motives," I remarked. "Your
reward will be in heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the man, who did not seem quite
to relish the idea of his reward being so indefinitely
postponed; "but the Effendi is going to
Sivas?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"He will see the Pacha there."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely."
</p>

<p>
"Then will he tell the Pacha of my great merits,
and ask him to give me some higher employment?"
</p>

<p>
"If it pleases Allah, you will receive some
higher post," I piously observed. "Our destinies
are in his hand."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the man, "so they are. But for all
that, I wish that you would speak to the Pacha for
me."
</p>

<p>
From the two examples I have here cited, it will
readily be seen that a system of promotion through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
favouritism is very deeply rooted amidst the Turks.
I had been seen riding with the Caimacan. It
was thought that I might see the Pacha at Sivas—this
was quite sufficient to induce some of the
inhabitants of Tokat to believe that any request
I might make to the Pacha or Caimacan would
necessarily be granted.
</p>

<p>
"It was fortunate," here remarked the engineer,
"that you told Osman to give the baksheesh to a
Corporal, and that a Turkish servant heard you
give the order. If the fellow had been a Christian,
the servant would never have taken the
trouble to mention it to him. But the fact of the
Corporal being a co-religionist was too much for
the servant. It has enabled you to detect the
fraud."
</p>

<p>
"This is one of the worst features of the country,"
he continued. "The Turks will not do anything
to aid a Christian at the expense of a Mohammedan,
even if the Mohammedan is most clearly in the
wrong. And it is much the same with the Christians
in respect to their co-religionists. The result
is that the Armenians and Turks do not pull well
together. The law, too, is faulty, and requires
amendment."
</p>

<p>
"Let me give you an example," continued Mr.
Gasparini, "and one which has come immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
under my notice, for it affected my own
servant. It sounds like a romance, but, alas!
is too true! My servant's name is Karatel Mermenk
Ovooloo. He is an Armenian; his mother
died when he was a child; his father remarried, but
behaved very badly to his second wife, continually
ill-treating her, and making his son bring another
woman to the house. The lad was very fond of
his stepmother, who was at that time seriously
ill; at last he refused to bring his father's
paramour to their home. The father beat him
severely and apprenticed the lad to his own trade,
that of a coppersmith. The mother soon afterwards
died, with an anathema on her lips at her
husband's paramour. The latter, strange to say,
died herself three weeks afterwards. In the
meantime, the father gave the boy three piastres
a week for his clothes. The lad could not clothe
himself for that sum, he left his home and went
into service. The parent succeeded in having the
boy turned away from several situations, but at
last I took him. Now, only the other day, the
father went to the Cadi, and swore that his son
was in a coppersmith's business with himself,
and in consequence must pay half the tax on
his trade. There is no truth whatever in the
statement, but the father's word has been taken,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
and my servant arrested, and kept in prison for
three days. The sum is only twenty-six piastres,
I would gladly pay it myself, but I have no
money; the government will not give me my
salary; so here we are at a dead-lock."

</p>

<p>
The following morning, Mohammed arrived at
an early hour, bringing with him his horse, a
wretched brute to look at; he had not a particle
of flesh on his bones, and was half blind with one
eye.
</p>

<p>
"This is my horse, Effendi," said Mohammed
proudly; "is he not a magnificent animal? My
having this horse will save the Effendi the expense
of hiring or buying another one."
</p>

<p>
"I hope that I shall get a baksheesh at Erzeroum,"
he added.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Of course," I said; "that is, if the brute
reaches Erzeroum. But it strikes me that you
have not been giving him anything to eat
lately!"
</p>

<p>
"No, Effendi, I was afraid that if he looked too
well he would have been taken for the use of the
troops; but no one will even glance at him as he
is. He has a wonderful appetite, and will make
up for lost time; no one will recognize him, after
he has eaten the Effendi's barley for a day or two;
he will soon be fat and strong."
</p>

<p>
The road from Tokat to Sivas is a good one for
the first few hours. My friend the engineer's
work had been very fairly done; our horses
were able to get over the ground at from five
to six miles an hour. The track led through
a succession of hills and valleys. In some
places the engineer had been obliged to cut
the road for several hundred yards in the solid
rock.
</p>

<p>
Presently we passed a small Circassian village.
Several good-looking women, coming to the road-side,
offered chickens and geese for sale. One of
the Circassians was a very pretty girl, and would
have carried off the palm amidst many European
belles. Her face was not veiled. There was a
great deal of expression in her large, dark eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
They flashed excitedly as she sought to induce
me to buy her wares.
</p>

<p>
"I am tired of chicken," I said; "I should like
a little meat."
</p>

<p>
"There is no meat here," replied the girl. "We
ourselves live upon bread and eggs: buy some
eggs."
</p>

<p>
And running back to a house, she brought
out about fifty eggs; the price being eightpence
of our money.
</p>

<p>
Now we came to Tchiflik, an Armenian village.
Here there were thirty houses; and as six hours
had sped by since we left Tokat, I determined to
halt for the night, the more particularly as Mohammed's
horse showed unmistakable signs of
fatigue.
</p>

<p>
The Armenian in whose house I stopped, complained
of his Circassian neighbours. According
to him, they had hazy ideas as to the difference
between <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>. Several cows belonging
to the villagers had recently disappeared. It
was strongly suspected that some Circassians were
implicated in the robbery.
</p>

<p>
The country in the neighbourhood was very
highly cultivated. The farmers' granaries were
full of corn. Hundreds of cows and cattle could
be seen grazing along the side of the road.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We arrived at the Tchamlay Bel mountain.
As we were ascending a narrow pass which
overhung a steep precipice, the guide, a Zaptieh,
observed that only five days previous a Turk had
been killed on this very spot. It appeared that
there was a band of brigands in the neighbourhood.
Five of them had attacked a party of four
Turkish merchants, who were returning from
Sivas with, as it was believed, a considerable
amount of gold on their persons. Three of the
Turks ran away, leaving their companion, who
showed fight, but was shot down; the brigands
had taken away from him thirty-five liras, besides
two horses. An hour later, when the news was
brought to a village, several of the inhabitants
turned out on horseback to pursue the robbers:
it was too late, they had made their escape and
carried off the booty.
</p>

<p>
"Do not be alarmed," said the guide as he
concluded his story. "I am with you; the
brigands will be afraid. Look here!" he carefully
unstrapped a long, single-barrelled flint gun
from his saddle-bow. The barrel was tied on to
the stock by a piece of string.
</p>

<p>
"It is a wonderful gun," said the guide. "It
belonged to my grandfather, I once shot a deer
with it."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Was the deer far off?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Very far," was the reply. "So far," pointing to
a rock about 1000 yards from us. It was clear
that however well the guide might shoot with his
gun, he was equally good with the long-bow.
I began to be a little doubtful about the story he
had just told us of the brigands.
</p>

<p>
We rested for a while at Yenihan, a large village
with 200 houses; the population is composed half
of Armenians and half of Turks. The Caimacan
had gone to the mountains in search of some
redif soldiery. He had experienced considerable
difficulty in inducing these men to leave their
homes, and join the army in the field.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing particular to see at Yenihan.
Sivas was only nine hours distant: I determined
to make a long march on the following day, and
give our horses a rest in that city. The track
was good. Ox-carts—the chief means of transporting
baggage in this part of Anatolia—have no
difficulty in travelling along the road to the Yeldez
Ermak, a rapid stream which is about seventy
yards wide. It is crossed by a good stone bridge
on arches. The river, though fordable in the
winter, would be impassable in the early spring if
it were not for the bridge. It is a tributary of the
Kizil Ermak, and meets that stream about twelve
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
miles S.E. of Sivas. The district is hilly, but
is highly cultivated. In about four hours we
reached the Kizil Ermak, a broad, deep river. It
is crossed by a stone bridge. A road on the opposite
bank leads to Divriki.
</p>

<p>
We did not cross the bridge, but continued on
to Sivas, which lay before us, with a background
of rising slopes. A citadel, in a ruined state,
frowned down upon us from the centre of the
city.
</p>

<p>
Sivas, the capital of Armenia Minor, is situated
at the head of the valley of the Halys of the
ancients. It is the most important military position
in this part of Turkey. It commands the
sole route which descends with the waters upon
the plateau of Asia Minor. Sivas is the key to
the Peninsula on the Asiatic side; the Turks
ought to fortify this place, particularly when they
are threatened in Asia Minor by the Russians.
Should the latter succeed in forcing the first line
of defence, consisting of Kars, Ardahan, and
Bayazid, and afterwards take possession of Erzeroum,
there will be no other fortified town between
themselves and Scutari.
</p>

<p>
The governor had sent an officer with some
Zaptiehs as an escort for our party. As we were
entering the principal street a servant approached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
us with a fine Arab horse, and said that the
Pacha hoped I would honour him by riding his
favourite animal to the quarters prepared for my
accommodation. It appeared that the Bey in
Angora had telegraphed to the governor of Sivas
about me, hence the preparations which had been
made.
</p>

<p>
I dismounted from my own quadruped, and
mounted the Pacha's horse. I now found that the
stirrup-leathers, even when let out to the last hole,
were much too short, I was sitting with my knees
nearly up to my chin.
</p>

<p>
The whole population of Sivas had turned out
to welcome me to their city. I should have
liked to have made my entry in as dignified a
manner as possible. Dignity soon became out
of the question. The Arab horse, unaccustomed
to sixteen stone on his back, began to kick.
To avoid ignominiously coming off, I was compelled
to take my feet out of the stirrups, and
ride without these appendages to the saddle.
</p>

<p>
Luckily the rooms prepared for us were not
far distant. On arriving in a small square, the
officers and Zaptiehs halted before a small, but
clean-looking house, which faced the Pacha's residence.
On the other sides of the square were
the prison and the barracks. The guard turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
out from the last-named building, and presented
arms as we dismounted. The officer of the escort,
taking my hand, led me up a staircase to the
apartment set aside for my accommodation.
</p>

<p>
Soon after our arrival I was waited upon by an
Italian engineer, who was employed at Sivas by
the government. He was the only European in the
city, which contains 7000 houses; however, there
were three American missionaries who had been
settled in Sivas for several years past with the
object of making proselytes.
</p>

<p>
The Italian was accompanied by an Armenian
who spoke French. The latter gentleman was
very indignant with the Pacha, who had shut up
the shops belonging to the Christians during the
previous week. It appeared that some of the
redif soldiers had pillaged a house in the market-place.
Several hundred more redifs were expected
to arrive at Sivas; there were hardly any
regular troops to keep order. The governor had
taken the precaution of closing all the shops belonging
to Armenians during the stay of the
redifs in the town. This was a precautionary
measure. It had given great umbrage to the
Christians. My visitor loudly denounced the proceeding.
</p>

<p>
"Are people ever tortured here?" I inquired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No," said the engineer; "the law is, or
rather the judges are, much too merciful. There
has been only one execution during the last three
years. The culprit was a soldier; his first wife
had been seduced by a neighbour. He put her
away and took another, but at the same time said
to his neighbour, 'If you seduce this woman I
will kill you!' The threat had no effect. The
soldier's second wife was treated as the former
one had been: he revenged himself by killing
the adulterer; for this offence he was hanged."
</p>

<p>
"Are people ever impaled here?" I inquired,
still having the two English priests who wrote
some letters to the <i>Times</i> about what they said
they had seen when travelling on the Danube, in
my mind's eye.
</p>

<p>
The Armenian smiled.
</p>

<p>
"No, not so bad as that. I believe a robber
was impaled eighteen years ago; at all events,
there is some tradition to that effect."
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards my visitors left the room.

</h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
The prison in Sivas—Christian prisoners—The gaoler—Kurds
and Circassians—A few Armenians—False statement made
to me by Christians—The old murderer—The firman for
his execution—Kept in suspense—Our Governor dislikes

</p>

<p>
The following day I walked across the square
to the prison. I had not said anything to the
authorities in Sivas about my intended visit to
this establishment. I wished to see it under its
everyday aspect, and at the same time to find out
if there were so many Christians prisoners as
the Armenians in Yuzgat would have had me
believe.
</p>

<p>
I found the gaoler seated in the doorway,
he was smoking a long pipe.
</p>

<p>
"Can I see the prison?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Effendi."
</p>

<p>
Going before me, he led the way to a lofty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'>285</a></span>
but narrow room. Here there were twenty-seven
prisoners, clothed in rags and tatters; each man
had his wrist fastened to his instep by a light
iron chain. No gaoler slept in this room with
the prisoners. They would not have had any difficulty
in freeing themselves from their manacles
had they tried to do so.
</p>

<p>
"What do you give them to eat?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"A loaf of bread (about 2 lbs. weight) every
day, and some water," was the reply. "However,
many of them have friends in the town,
and they are supplied with provisions from outside."
</p>

<p>
"What are the prisoners mostly here for?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"For robbery and murder. We have a great
many Kurds and Circassians for horse and cattle
stealing. Then there are a few Armenians, the
latter chiefly for crime connected with money
matters."
</p>

<p>
"How many prisoners are there altogether?"
I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"One hundred and two."
</p>

<p>
"And how many Christians?"
</p>

<p>
"Six; all the rest belong to Islam."
</p>

<p>
As the population of Sivas is fairly divided
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
between the two sects, it was very flattering for
the Armenians that there should be so few of their
number amongst the prisoners. But, after what
I had been told at Yuzgat, my belief in the
truthfulness of their community was very much
shaken.
</p>

<p>
In another part of the gaol there were several
prisoners without chains. They were walking
about in an enclosed courtyard. One of them,
an old man who was very much bowed down
by years, appealed to us. Taking my hand he
touched it with his forehead, and then besought
me to speak to the Pacha for him.
</p>

<p>
"What is he here for?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"For murder," was the reply; "and a very
cold-blooded murder too."
</p>

<p>
"He is a Circassian," continued the gaoler,
"and the firman for his execution arrived at Sivas
two years ago."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the old man, in a whining voice,
"two years ago! and I have been kept in suspense
ever since. It is an awful thing, Effendi—I
never know from one hour to another that it
may not be my last!"
</p>

<p>
"Why was he not executed?" I inquired of
the official.
</p>

<p>
"Our Governor dislikes shedding blood," said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
the gaoler," and he has put the firman away in a
drawer."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," interrupted the aged murderer; "Issek
Pacha is a kind man, he will not put me to death;
but he is very old—he may die! The Governor
who will succeed him might find the firman, and
order me to be hanged!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what do you want me to do?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Only, Effendi, to beseech the Pacha to tear up
the firman!" cried the old man in imploring
tones. "Let me end my years in the prison, for
here every one is kind to me; and let me not be
strangled at the end of a rope on the scaffold!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will speak to Issek Pacha," I said;
and with difficulty escaping from the murderer,
who threw himself on all fours and frantically
embraced my legs, I walked to the governor's
residence.
</p>

<p>
He was seated on a sofa at one end of a large
hall, and surrounded by attendants with documents
awaiting his signature. He at once rose,
and motioned to me to sit down by his side. After
the customary salutations, I mentioned to him that
I had just visited the prison and had seen the old
murderer.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! you have seen him," said the Pacha gravely,
at the same time slowly stroking his stomach.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
"He is in a great state of mind, I believe, lest
I should die before he does, and my successor
order the sentence to be put into execution. But
he has nothing to fear; I have the firman safe in
my drawer, and am trying to arrange the matter
with the relatives of the murdered man."
</p>

<p>
It appears that there is a curious law in
Turkey, to the effect that if a man has committed
a murder, and the order for his execution has
come from Constantinople, the Pacha whose duty
it is to have the sentence carried out need not do
so, provided that the relations of the murdered person
request that the assassin's life may be spared.
</p>

<p>
This frequently gives rise to mercenary dealings
between the assassin and the relatives, for the latter
hold his life in their hands. If the murderer is
rich, he will often have to give up all his property;
and then if the relations pardon him, the law enacts
that he must spend fifteen years in gaol. The
manner of carrying out this part of the sentence is
extremely lax. Should the friends of the prisoner
be able to scrape together enough money to satisfy
the officials connected with the prison, the murderer
will be allowed to escape and remain at large
in his native town.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day two Armenian gentlemen
called upon me. Presently one of them remarked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
that Issek Pacha was immensely rich,
and that many tales were in circulation about
him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said his companion, "there is a story to
the effect that one day the Grand Vizier was walking
by the side of the Bosphorus with the late
Sultan Abdul Aziz. A beautiful yacht, the
property of Issek Pacha, happened to be anchored
close to the royal palace. 'What a magnificent
vessel!' said the Sultan. 'To whom does it
belong?' The Grand Vizier," continued the
Armenian, "did not much like the Governor of
Sivas, and replied, 'It was the property of Issek
Pacha, but he has sent it here to be placed at
your majesty's disposal.' 'Write and say that I
accept it with pleasure,' said the Sultan. The
first notification which Issek Pacha had of this
transaction was the receipt of an official letter from
Constantinople enclosing the Sultan's thanks for
the present.
</p>

<p>
"A subscription had been recently started in
the vilayet or province of Sivas, with the object
of collecting funds to enable the Government
to continue the war. Ten thousand liras were
collected. The Pacha sent the money to the
Grand Vizier without exactly stating the sources
from which it was derived. The minister at once
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
ordered the receipt of this sum, as coming from
Issek Pacha, to be acknowledged in the public
journals; he also desired a secretary to write
an official letter to the governor to thank him for
his large donation, and say in the postscript that
when the rest of the people in the province of
Sivas had sent in their subscriptions, he was to
forward them immediately to Constantinople.
Our Pacha did not like this letter," continued my
informant. "However, what could he do? he is
an enormously rich man, and, though it went very
much against the grain, he sent a fresh 10,000 liras
to the Porte."
</p>

<p>
It was clear that the Armenians did not
love their Pacha. From what I subsequently
heard, their dislike to him originates in the fact
that he is not amenable to bribes. That he is not
a miser can be easily shown. Misers are not in
the habit of expending large sums of money in the
construction of public buildings. Issek Pacha
at the time of my stay in Sivas was having a
large mosque built in the town of Erzingan, at
his own expense. It was said that this building
would cost him 40,000 Turkish liras.
</p>

<p>
Three American missionaries called; they had
been settled for several years in Anatolia, and
had succeeded in making some converts amidst the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
Armenians, but they had not in any one instance
induced a Mohammedan to change his faith.
</p>

<p>
I inquired if it were true, as stated at Yuzgat,
that Armenian boys and girls had been carried
away from their parents, and shut up in Issek
Pacha's seraglio.
</p>

<p>
"No! no," said one of my visitors. "At all
events, we have never heard of anything at all
authentic as to such proceedings." When I
mentioned the subject of impalement, and asked
if they had ever known of any Christians who had
been impaled by the Pacha's orders, the three
missionaries seemed very much surprised at the
question, one of them observed that the Turks
were by no means a cruel race; but that their
system of administering justice was a bad one.
</p>

<p>
I now learnt that the proprietor of the house in
which I was living was a shoemaker. The Pacha
had hired from him the apartments which I
occupied, and which were generally given to travellers.
Mohammed, when he gave me this piece
of information, suggested that it would be a good
opportunity for me to buy him a pair of boots.
</p>

<p>
"Such beautiful boots as there are downstairs,"
he continued, "the Effendi could get both
his feet into one of them. They will keep out
the cold. If I do not have something over my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
slippers I shall be frost-bitten before we reach
Kars!"
</p>

<p>
The proprietor brought the boots for my
inspection. He had a very Jewish type of
countenance, and at once commenced driving a
bargain with Mohammed.
</p>

<p>
"But you told me downstairs that the boots
were 125 piastres, and now you ask 165!"
observed the Turkish servant indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"They are my boots, and not yours!" said the
Armenian, "and I shall charge what I like for
them!"
</p>

<p>
It appeared that the difference of opinion
between Mohammed and the shoemaker had
arisen owing to the Armenian thinking that he
would be paid in <i>caime</i>, or bank notes, and not
in silver. Caime in Sivas had fallen to 165
piastres the lira. It was formerly 125; so by the
depreciation of the paper currency the shoemaker
would lose 40 piastres on every pair of boots he
sold, if purchased from him at the present rate of
exchange. Many of the Turks were alarmed at
the constant fall in the value of their paper
currency. They objected very strongly to being
paid any large sums in Turkish bank-notes.
According to the son of Crispin, only ten years
previous the Government had issued an immense
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
quantity of caime, and had said that in the
following month of March this paper would
be accepted in payment of the taxes.
</p>

<p>
"March arrived," continued the shoemaker,
"we took our caime to the tax-collectors. They
would not receive it.  A vast number of the
notes then issued are still in the possession of
merchants in this town, and are valueless."
</p>

<p>
When I was in Yuzgat Mr. Vankovitch had
asked me to intercede with Issek Pacha for an
Italian lady, the widow of a Pole who had died a
few months previously in Sivas. The Pole had
been the chief engineer in the district, and at the
time of his death was owed about 120<i>l</i>. by the
Turkish authorities. His widow had applied to
the Pacha for this sum, but was refused payment
on the ground that she had a son, and that
her late husband's father was still living.
</p>

<p>
"You must write to your husband's Ambassador,"
said the Pacha, "and ask him to
inform us how the law of succession is applied in
his country, we will then pay you everything to
which you are entitled."
</p>

<p>
In the meantime an inhabitant took pity upon
the Italian lady, and had received her into his
harem. Here she was now living, and anxiously
awaiting a reply from Constantinople to her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
letter. Months passed away, no answer came.
The poor woman had exhausted the small resources
which she possessed at the time of her
husband's death.

</p>

<p>
I was thinking of calling upon the Italian lady
when Mohammed, running into my room, informed
me that the governor was actually coming in person
to call upon me, and that it was a great
honour; for some time before this the Khedive's
treasurer had passed through Sivas, and Issek
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
Pacha had not deigned to visit him, but had conversed
with the Egyptian from the street.
</p>

<p>
"See what a great man you are, Effendi!"
said the delighted Mohammed. "The equal of a
Pacha too! fortunate is my fate that I have been
assigned to you as a servant!"
</p>

<p>
The governor drove up to the door in a
vehicle which very much resembled a brewer's
dray. It was the only carriage of any sort or
kind in Sivas. This fact alone added considerably
to the Pacha's importance in that town. He
was a corpulent man, and required a great deal of
pushing at the hands of his two attendants to
make him pass through the doorway of the
carriage; two steps enabled the person inside the
vehicle to descend to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Issek Pacha, turning with great caution,
walked backwards, his two servants holding his
feet and guiding them to the steps below. After
resting a few seconds, to recover from this
exertion, the governor slowly mounted the staircase
which led to my apartment.
</p>

<p>
He now told me that twenty-five years ago the
Turks and Christians got on very well together, but
ever since the Crimean war the Russian Government
has been actively engaged in tampering with the
Armenian subjects of the Porte, and has been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
doing its best to sow the seeds of disaffection
amongst the younger Armenians, by promising
to make them counts and dukes in the event of
their rising in arms against the Porte.
</p>

<p>
"If it were not for Russian intrigues," continued
the Pacha, "we Turks should be very good friends
with the Christians. But Ignatieff is very clever,
he will not let us alone, and does his best to create
discord in our ranks."
</p>

<p>
I mentioned the case of the Italian lady, and
asked him if he could not do something for her.
</p>

<p>
"It is a very difficult question," replied the
Pacha; "her husband, the engineer, was a refugee
Pole, and had lost his nationality as a Russian
subject. Moreover, his father lives in Russia, and
may claim that the son's property should be
administered according to Muscovite laws. Then
there is an infant child; and, besides this, the lady
herself is an Italian, and is expecting another
baby. We have written to Constantinople for
instructions, when they arrive we shall know
what proportion of the husband's property is due
to the widow."
</p>

<p>
"What should you advise to be done in the
matter?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"My opinion is that you ought to give the lady
sufficient money to pay her expenses so far as Constantinople;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
for there she can speak to her own
Ambassador, and arrange the business more easily
than it can be done here."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bad idea," said the Pacha. "I
will advance two months of her husband's salary."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Gell!</i> come!" he cried to a crowd of servants
who were waiting outside, and whilst one attendant
handed him a cigarette, and a second some coffee,
the Pacha desired a third to tell his treasurer that
he wished to speak to him immediately. This
official now arrived.
</p>

<p>
"I want two months' wages from the sum owing
to the late engineer to be brought here at once,"
said the governor.
</p>

<p>
"But no order about the distribution of the
property has come from Constantinople," replied
the treasurer hesitatingly; "if we pay any
money to the widow, we shall be held responsible
for it ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"No," I said, "I will be responsible for the
amount. If the authorities at Constantinople say
that you have done wrong, I will repay you the
money."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not," said the Pacha; "the responsibility
is mine. My orders are to be instantly
obeyed," he added.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Is the money to be paid in caime or silver?"
asked the treasurer.
</p>

<p>
"Silver," was the reply. "When the poor
woman's husband died, caime was worth as much
as medjidis, but now there is a great difference,
she must not be the loser. Run!" he cried.
</p>

<p>
"On my head be it!" replied the treasurer.
In a few minutes he returned with a small sack of
silver.
</p>

<p>
"Will you take it to the lady yourself?" said
the governor, handing me the bag. "And when
do you leave Sivas?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Probably in three days' time."
</p>

<p>
"Well," continued the governor, "you will pass
by Erzingan, where I have some property, and I
hope you will stay in my house. Nay, no thanks.
It will be doing me an honour, and I have written
for rooms to be prepared. I shall send some
Zaptiehs with you," he added.
</p>

<p>
"I do not want any."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, but you must have some. You will
have terrible hard work in crossing the mountains
between this and Divriki. There are
already two or three feet of snow on the track.
In some places you will require men to dig
a way before your party. You do not know
what the cold is in this country," he continued.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
"I was once nearly frozen to death myself, going
from Kars to Erzeroum, just about the time of the
Crimean war. I had 500 soldiers with me; a
snow-storm came on, we lost our way. My men
strayed in different directions. I had furs, and was
able to resist the cold, but when we counted up
my party the next morning, more than half the
men were frost-bitten, and several had died during
the night. There is another reason why you require
several guides," added the governor. "The path
over the mountains is covered with snow, and
there are deep chasms and fissures alongside the
track, some of them are more than a hundred feet
deep. The guides carry poles, and will sound the
path before your horses, otherwise you will not
have much chance of reaching Kars."
</p>

<p>
"The Conference is over," said the Pacha, as he
rose from the divan. "The news has been telegraphed
to us from Constantinople."
</p>

<p>
"What has been the result of it?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing! What else could you expect?
Particularly when Russia, the cause and origin of
all our difficulties, was permitted to have a representative
at the Conference—and such a representative—for
General Ignatieff is a cunning old
fox!"
</p>

<p>
Then shaking hands with me—which I afterwards
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
learned from Mohammed was a very great
honour—the Pacha waddled downstairs, and drove
to his official residence.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day I rode to the missionaries'
home, a pleasant little house situated in the
outskirts of the town. On their arrival in
Sivas they had taken an abode from some
Armenians, but the latter demanded such an
exorbitant rent for the house in question that
the missionaries determined to build one for
themselves.
</p>

<p>
My friends' names were Perry, Hubbard, and
Riggs. They received me with that hospitality
which an Englishman always receives from Americans,
no matter whether they meet him in the
States or elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Two of these gentlemen had brought their
wives with them from America. Several ruddy-faced
and pretty children who were playing in the
room showed that the climate of Sivas was in no
way an unhealthy one.
</p>

<p>
The ladies liked the place; but when they first
came here they had to put up with a great deal of
annoyance, owing to the Turkish little boys. The
latter, unaccustomed to see women walking about
in European costume, and with their faces uncovered,
had sometimes followed them in the street
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
and thrown mud at their dresses. Whenever
this occurred, and any elder Turks were present,
they had chastised their young compatriots and
put an immediate end to the disturbance.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say," observed one of the missionaries,
"that it was a strange sight for the people in
Sivas to see our ladies walking about the town.
However, if a Turkish woman were put down in
the streets of New York, I reckon that she would
have a crowd at her heels before long."
</p>

<p>
This remark reminded me of an episode which
had recently occurred in America, and which had
found its way into the newspapers. It appeared
that a Chinese lad was selling sweets and lollipops
in New Orleans, when a burly native, coming up
to him, kicked over the tray and the boy's wares.
The lad, without a word of remonstrance, picked
up his lollipops. The man a second time upset
them into the mud. The child looked at his
tormentor, and, collecting his sweetmeats, said to
him, "You are a Christian and I am a heathen;
I should be sorry to change places with you!"
</p>

<p>
"There are bad people all over the world,"
remarked one of the missionaries; "the poor
ignorant Turks are not nearly so cruel as some
people would have us believe."
</p>

<p>
"No, they are not cruel," observed another
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
gentleman, "but they are pig-headed—that is
their great fault. They will not advance with the
times in which they live; if they adopt European
inventions, they copy them blindly, and
without adapting them to circumstances. Soon
after the telegraph was invented, the Turks determined
to have special lines, and to use
the Turkish alphabet; the man who was employed
to arrange the system copied it blindly from
our own. Now 'E' and 'I,' the fifth and ninth
letters in our alphabet, are those which occur very
frequently in an ordinary message; in Europe
the telegraph dial is so arranged as to facilitate
the transmission of the letters most often employed.
The Turk, when he came to 'I,' and
found it was the ninth letter in our alphabet,
placed the ninth in his own on the same footing,
whereas that letter is, comparatively speaking,
but seldom used."
</p>

<p>
"A few years ago," observed one of the missionaries,
"there was an Englishman here connected
with the Anglo-Indian Telegraph. We
were then as well supplied with information as the
people in London or New York. It was the time
of the French war, and all the news was sent daily
from England to Hindostan. Our friend used to
tap the wire, and send us a little budget of information
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
every morning; but now he has gone, and
all that we hear is several weeks or months old."
</p>

<p>
"There was actually a great deal of difficulty in
introducing the potato plant," remarked another
gentleman; "this will give you an idea of the
nature of the people with whom we have to deal.
Some foreigners brought over the seeds and
planted them. They came up very well; the
soil is admirably suited for their growth. But
the natives would not eat the potatoes. It
was not until the military authorities, who were
short of provisions, supplied them to the soldiers
in lieu of other edibles that the soldiers would partake
of this vegetable. They soon acquired a taste
for it, and potato culture is gradually spreading
throughout the district."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what it is," said another missionary,
"the Turks about here are just the inside-out-sidest
and the outside-insidest, the bottom-side-upwardest
and the top-side-downwardest, the
back-side-forwardest and the forward-side-backwardest
people I have ever seen. Why, they call
a compass, which points to the north, 'Quebleh,'
south, just for the sake of contradiction, and they
have to change their watches every twenty-four
hours, because they count their time from after sunset,
instead of reckoning up the day like Christians."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The peculiarity of this gentleman's expressions
rather struck me at the time. It was clear that
he had not formed a favourable opinion of the Sultan's
Mohammedan subjects; but when I changed
the conversation to the Armenians, I found that
the company looked upon them as being quite
as ignorant as the Turks, and much more deceitful.
</p>

<p>
The good missionaries found the conversion of
these superstitious and ignorant Christians of the
East a very difficult and uphill task. Indeed I
subsequently heard from some Armenian Roman
Catholics, who might have been prejudiced in
making the statement, that most of the converts
to Protestantism were from amongst the Armenian
shop-keepers who supplied the mission with
goods.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing the Russians were to conquer
Anatolia, what would be the position of the
Protestant mission?" I inquired of my hosts.
</p>

<p>
"We should be immediately turned out of
the country to make way for the Russian
priests," was the answer. "The Tzar's Government
does not tolerate any religion save its
own."
</p>

<p>
This remark struck me, coming, as it did,
not from an English Protestant, but from an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
American, and from an inhabitant of that country
which, in spite of its Republican institutions, has
always been thought to have a great sympathy
with Russia.
</p>

<p>
So the Government of this last-mentioned
Empire would not brook any foreign mission in
its territory, and the Emperor would not be likely
to allow American missionaries to impart to the
Russian idolaters a knowledge of the Protestant
faith.
</p>

<p>
Protestantism implies freedom of thought. The
right of investigation would be very displeasing
to a despotic set of rulers. The superstitions
and debased form of worship attached to the
Greek religion have no chance of being replaced by
our pure Protestant faith, until such time as the
autocratic system of government which prevails
throughout Russia is terminated by a revolution.

</p>

<p>
The following day I rode to an Armenian
monastery, which is known by the name of the
Monastery of Nishan or of the Cross. It stands
on a rising slope, about two miles from Sivas.
Its Gothic towers, more than 500 years old, look
down upon the town and neighbouring villages,
and can be seen for many miles around.
</p>

<p>
A large garden, over thirty acres in extent,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
enclosed by a high wall made of dried clay,
supplies the monks with fruit and vegetables.
It bounds the monastery upon one side; on the
other there are several farms, which furnish
cattle, sheep, and such other live stock as may be
required.
</p>

<p>
A long low passage with damp walls led the
way, with many a winding turn, to the apartment
which had been reserved for my use.
</p>

<p>
Here I found the bishop and several other
priests belonging to the community. The ceiling
of the room was of handsomely-carved oak, and
divans, as in the Turkish houses, supplied the
place of chairs. Some Armenian merchants now
arrived, and shortly afterwards dinner was announced.
</p>

<p>
It was a fast day. The bishop himself could
not partake of the dishes. However, he gave permission
to the other guests to break the fast, and
a turkey stuffed with apples—the <i><span lang="fr_FR">pièce de résistance</span></i>—was
nothing to the hungry visitors; the
dinner being in the Turkish style, made up of a
series of surprises to our stomachs.
</p>

<p>
According to one of the Armenians, the
Turkish finance was in an utterly hopeless condition.
</p>

<p>
"Our Government," he remarked, "first said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
that it would only issue paper money to the
amount of 3,000,000 liras, and we have caime
to the value of 11,000,000 liras in circulation!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said another merchant, "the lira is
now at 160 piastres, but if there is a war it will
rise to 500."
</p>

<p>
"The Government will be the loser in the long
run," he continued, "every one is speculating
for the fall, and we are buying up all the gold
we can."
</p>

<p>
I now learnt that the Armenian merchants in
Sivas employed the telegraph very freely in their
monetary speculations. The inhabitants in
general only knew of the rise or fall in the value
of their paper money by the post, which arrived
once every fortnight. The value of caime in
proportion to gold was reckoned according to
the date of the post's delivery. But, as the
Turkish bank-notes were becoming more and
more depreciated every day, the Armenian merchants
who employed the telegraph were able
to make large sums by buying up all the gold in
the district, and pocketing the difference between
the actual exchange and that which passed
current at Sivas.
</p>

<p>
The walls of the monastery were not thick
enough to keep the breath of scandal from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
reaching the abode of the recluses. I was told
of a former governor of Sivas, who had been extremely
popular throughout the district, and who
in forty days had actually established order in the
town and neighbourhood. It appeared that this
Pacha was a very good-looking man. One day,
when he was at Constantinople, a sister of the late
Sultan Abdul Aziz chanced to see him. She wished
to marry the Adonis; "but unfortunately,"
added my Armenian informant, "he was in
love with his own wife, a pretty woman. He
declined the Sultan's offer to take his sister, who
was not good-looking, as chief lady in the harem.
Soon afterwards the Pacha died at Smyrna under
very suspicious circumstances. It is generally
supposed that he was poisoned."
</p>

<p>
"His Eminence is freed from all such dangers,"
whispered another of the guests, as he called my
attention by a nudge with his elbow.
</p>

<p>
"How so?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, he cannot marry. Our bishops are not
allowed this indulgence. Should a priest take
unto himself a wife, he can never become a
bishop."
</p>

<p>
"How does your system answer?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Answer! very badly. They are not allowed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
to have wives of their own; but they look after
the welfare of the ladies in their congregation.
Are your Protestant bishops allowed to
marry?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it would be a good thing for the married
people in Armenia, if our bishops had the
same permission."
</p>

<p>
I now went to see the chapels belonging to the
monastery.
</p>

<p>
An altar in one of them was profusely decorated
with gold and other ornaments. It was erected
to the memory of the four martyrs of Sivas who
were torn to pieces by the Pagans about 1500
years ago. It is said that our Saviour shortly afterwards
appeared to the inhabitants of the town in the
form of a bird, and alighted upon a large stone
near the place where the four Christians had been
murdered. The stone was subsequently taken to
the monastery, and this altar had been erected
upon it. In another chapel, there was a picture of
one of the kings of Armenia in the act of being
consecrated by an archbishop of Sivas. The holy
father who called my attention to this picture
pointed to the suppliant form of the king, who
was kneeling before a priest, and to a monk
who was writing the date of the coronation on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
a scroll of parchment, and looking down upon the
sovereign.
</p>

<p>
"Things are very different to what they were
then," remarked the priest. "In those days
even kings had to obey the holy Church. They
do not think anything of us now," he added,
with a sigh; "instead of giving presents to the
Church, they take away from it the few privileges
and the little wealth it has left."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any privileges belonging to your
order?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Only one; we have not to pay any duty upon
salt, and I suppose that even this slight exemption
from taxation will be taken away from us ere
long."
</p>

<p>
A throne belonging to a former king of Armenia
was next produced. It was made of ebony, and
in form much resembled a shut-up garden-chair,
but one of gigantic dimensions. The sovereign
for whom this throne had been made, died several
hundred years ago at Sivas. The worthy fathers
differed a few hundred years as to the date of the
monarch's decease, and so it is impossible for me
to give it. His bones were taken to Van, and
interred there; however, his sons reigned for
many years afterwards, and held their court at
Sivas.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Our nation has had a great many reverses,"
said the bishop; "but who knows what is in
store for us?"
</p>

<p>
"We do not want any Russian rulers!" said
an old Armenian merchant. "When I was
a child," he continued, "the Russians made war
upon the Persians. A general, second in command
of the Russian forces, was an Armenian.
The head of our Church helped the Russians, and
25,000 Armenians were levied to aid them in the
war against the Shah. The Persian army was
annihilated; twenty-five cities were destroyed;
the invading forces advanced towards Teheran.
The Shah then made a treaty with Russia."
</p>

<p>
"What has that got to do with your dislike
of the Russians?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" said the old man. "After the war
was over, the Russian chief was alarmed lest the
Armenian general, who was a very skilful officer,
might make himself King of Armenia. He
accused him of treason, had his eyes taken out,
and sent him a prisoner to Russia."<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a>
</p>

<p>
"The Russians would not have been pleased if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
we had been made independent at that time," said
a priest. "They have always looked upon us as
a certain inheritance, all they want to do is to
take our territory without having to fight for
it."
</p>

<p>
"We revenged ourselves upon Hassan, Khan
of Persia, who had defiled one of our churches
near Ararat," remarked the old merchant.
"He was taken prisoner and transported to the
church which he had desecrated. He was afterwards
tied face to face with a dog, and given
the same food as that animal. The Persian soon
died of shame or starvation."
</p>

<p>
There is but little export trade from Sivas.
Tobacco is the staple produce of the country.
All the articles imported are very dear, owing to
the expense of transport from Samsoun, the roads
between Sivas and that port being very bad.
</p>

<p>
Sugar, I was informed, costs eighteenpence a
pound. If an enterprising inhabitant were to
start a manufactory of this article of consumption,
he would speedily make an immense fortune.
Beetroot and a peculiar sort of sweet carrot
abound throughout the district. The first-mentioned
vegetable can be bought for eight shillings
a ton. It might be grown for very much less.
Any amount of water power could be brought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
from the neighbouring mountains to bear upon
machinery. Coal is also to be found in the
neighbourhood. This part of Anatolia is supplied
with sugar from Constantinople. If it were
manufactured on the spot, the profit would be
very great, for the cost of carriage would be saved;
in all probability it would utterly supplant the
Constantinople sugar, and soon find a market
throughout the whole of Asia Minor.

</p>

<p>
On leaving the monastery, we rode to the principal
mosque of the town. I was struck by seeing
a large ostrich egg suspended from the ceiling
by a silver chain. On my asking the Turk who
showed me over the building, why this egg was
hung there, he replied,—
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, the ostrich always looks at the eggs
which she lays; if one of them is bad, she breaks it.
This egg is suspended here as a warning to men
that, if they are bad, God will break them in the
same way as the ostrich does her eggs."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mohammed met me as I was returning to my
house. He was very much excited.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, a regiment is about to march to
Erzeroum. It will be a grand sight. The Pacha
will accompany it out of the town. The dancing
dervishes will go before the band. Other dervishes
will be there with sharp knives; they will cut
themselves, but the blood will not flow! It will
be a miracle! And all this we can see from the
Effendi's window!"
</p>

<p>
"Happy are you, O Mohammed, to be able to
see such wonderful sights without paying for
them," I remarked; then, giving him my horse, I
went upstairs to my room.
</p>

<p>
An immense crowd had gathered in the square;
the part facing the barracks was thronged by
hundreds of idlers who were eagerly pressing
against the gates. Presently they were thrown
wide open. The governor, in his dray-like
carriage, issued from the portals. He was accompanied
by the colonel of the regiment, who
was mounted on a superb grey, and rode by the
side of the Pacha's vehicle.
</p>

<p>
Next came six dancing dervishes clad in sackcloth,
and with long cowls over their green
turbans. They in their turn were followed by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
about twenty men—some carrying what appeared
to be bill-hooks—others, maces with leaden balls
attached to them by chains, and bright steel
skewers.
</p>

<p>
"This is delightful!" said Mohammed, who, by
way of seeing better, had climbed on to the top of
the divan, torn away the piece of paper which
supplied the place of a pane of glass, and, having
thrust his head and shoulders through the aperture,
was staring with his mouth wide open at the procession.
</p>

<p>
"Please God they will soon begin to cut themselves!"
</p>

<p>
However, he was doomed to disappointment;
the dervishes had already cut themselves in the
barrack-yard, and were not inclined to repeat the
performance.
</p>

<p>
On they went in serried ranks, followed by the
troopers, all of whom were excellently mounted on
horses averaging about fifteen hands, and which
looked in capital condition. The men were armed
with American revolvers and repeating-rifles,
whilst a short curved scimitar hung by each man's
side.
</p>

<p>
"How long will it be before they reach
Erzeroum?" I inquired of Mohammed.
</p>

<p>
"About a month," was the answer; "but they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
are going by a short route by Kara Hissar, and
we by Divriki, Arabkir, and Egin, which will be a
long way round. We shall arrive first at our
destination, as the regiment will not march more
than sixteen miles a day."
</p>

<p>
The Pacha ordered his coachman to draw
up the carriage on one side of the road; the
dervishes raised a mournful yell. The regiment,
passing onward, was lost to view behind an avenue
of poplars.
</p>

<p>
The following morning I started at daybreak in
the direction of Dudusa, a village about five hours
from Sivas. For some distance we marched alongside
the left bank of the Kizil Ermak. The track
was very heavy. The baggage-horses had great
difficulty in making a way through the mud.
Presently we came upon some firm soil. The
scenery changed from a flat expanse of plough-land
to a winding chain of rugged heights.
Chain succeeded chain. Snowy crests were piled
up in rear of each other like the billows of
the deep. Our path led round these mountain
peaks. From time to time we caught a glimpse
of the Kizil Ermak, which, white as silver, flowed
through the vale at our feet. Nature's walls on all
sides of us were of every colour; at every moment,
red, blue, and grey sandstone met our gaze.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We round a neighbouring crag; a vast rock
of the purest marble lies before our party. Huge
blocks strew the borders of the path; they sparkle
beneath the sky, and rival in their Parian whiteness
the snowy heights overhead. On the summit
of an adjacent hill is the monastery of Dudusa,
and at its foot the village of the same name, made
up of straggling houses, built at long intervals
apart—some of mud and marble; others—where
the inhabitants had been too idle to transport
the blocks from the adjacent rock—of dried
clay; and a few of the abodes of the better-to-do
farmers actually boasting glass windows!
In other houses the panes were replaced by
paper or pieces of some transparent alabaster,
which is found in large quantities in the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
Dudusa is an Armenian village. I now learnt
that Issek Pacha was very popular amongst the
villagers. I must say that I was a little surprised
at this, after the way the Armenians in Sivas had
abused their governor. Two months previous,
some Turks, from a neighbouring hamlet, had
made a raid on the flocks belonging to the inhabitants
of Dudusa, and had carried off fifty sheep.
Information of the robbery was given to the
Pacha, he at once sent out a party of soldiers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
The robbers had been arrested. They were
expiating their offence in prison.
</p>

<p>
I had heard at Sivas that a redif battalion
which had lately marched to Erzeroum had outraged
some women near Dudusa. I took the
opportunity to inquire if the story were true.
Like many other statements which had been
made to me by the so-called Christians in Anatolia,
it turned out to be a fiction. The redif soldiers
had passed that way. The only thing which could
be said against them was that they had not paid
for the bread with which they had been supplied,
as the military authorities had not given them any
money. There were no officers with the troops,
but the men had given the name of their regiment.
On application to head-quarters, the amount due
would be transmitted to the villagers.
</p>

<p>
I did not stay long at Dudusa, but, after lunching
at the priest's house, continued the march
towards Kotnu, another village about twenty-seven
miles, or about nine hours from the capital of the
province.
</p>

<p>
It was dusk long ere we reached our halting-place.
In passing over a narrow wooden bridge,
one of my horses put his foot down a hole between
the planks, and nearly broke his leg. Misfortunes
never come singly. A moment later, the poor brute
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
strayed a few yards from the track. He was at
once bogged in the treacherous soil. Everything
had to be unstrapped from the saddle, a rope was
attached to his surcingle, and then, by means of
the other horses, he was dragged from the
slimy trammels. It was hard work loading him
again.
</p>

<p>
The thermometer had fallen to considerably below
zero. The wind howled and blew the snowy
flakes in our faces. The horses would not stand
still. Our matches were wet through. We could
not light them. Under such circumstances we
had to arrange the baggage.
</p>

<p>
The Zaptiehs who had been sent to act as
guides would not help; they sat still, cursing
their destiny which had made them accompany a
mad giaour like myself, who had chosen to travel
from Scutari to Kars all the way by land, instead
of going the greater part of the distance by sea,
like a sensible true believer. I have but little doubt
that the same train of thought was passing through
Mohammed's and Radford's mind. However,
the latter never flinched, and Mohammed had
evidently won his friendship, for, on my asking my
English servant how he liked his new companion,
he replied, "Sir, he is worth three of Osman at
any time, save praying-times, and then there is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
not a pin to choose between them. They must be
awful sinners, these Mohammedans, if they require
five prayers a day to settle the account with their
consciences. Mohammed ain't that artful as
Osman was. He don't choose the moment when
there is work to be done, to set to work at his
victuals, or to flop down on his knees to say
his prayers. Mohammed has his pray all to
himself afterwards, and then it don't so much
signify!"
</p>

<p>
"What! Has not Mohammed so good an
appetite as Osman?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, Mohammed has more of a Christian's
appetite; he is satisfied with what I put before
him, he don't go prigging out of the tin like
that there other Turk. Why, I watched Osman
one day eating a chicken which I had kept back
for your supper! A few days before, I had
missed one out of the pot, and had taxed him
with it; he then said, '<i>keupek</i>,' dog, as if a dog
would go and lift up the lid of the tin! I used to
call Osman 'keupek' afterwards, and he did not
seem to like it. The other Turks, when they
want to give it a fellow, tell him that he is
the grandson of a dog; but I called Osman the
original animal—dirty hound that he was too—quite
spoiled my coat, that he did!"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
</p>

<p>
And my servant, lighting a short wooden pipe,
the wonder of the Turks, smoked furiously—the
rapidity of his puffs probably denoting an extreme
dislike to his late fellow-servant.

down a chasm—Probing the ground—A

</p>

<p>
Snow fell heavily during the night. The next
morning our path was covered to a depth of
quite two feet. In the valley it was as much as
our horses could do to force a passage onward;
but, as we ascended a mountain path, the snow,
though deep, was in a frozen state, and afforded a
firm foothold.
</p>

<p>
The scenery was very picturesque as we gradually
climbed the steep. The bushes and pine-trees
which studded the mountain's sides were
wreathed in flossy snow; crags of all shapes and
colours glinted out above the pale white carpet.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
A thick veil of azure clouds hung on the peaks of
the distant hills; then, gradually dispersed by the
rising sun, it broke up into a hundred different
forms, and, ascending higher in the sky, opened
out other mountains to our vision. Layer upon
layer of seemingly ever-ascending ranges barred
the way in front. They sparkled beneath the rays
of the golden orb. They flashed and glittered
like the billows of the mighty deep. My eyeballs
acted and felt as if they would burst beneath the
glare. The village at our feet disappeared in the
distance; shrubs and such-like traces of vegetation
were now no longer to be seen. We had
arrived in the midst of what seemed to be a vast
white ocean. The intensity of the light created
a kind of mirage along the surface. The various
crests and ranges seemed to rise and fall. They
became more wave-like than before. Not a
living thing was in sight save ourselves. Ever
and anon a boom, as of thunder, announced the
fall of an avalanche.
</p>

<p>
The cry of "Look out!" from a Zaptieh in
rear of our party awoke me from the contemplation
of Nature's marvellous scene. A second
later, and I found myself on the broad of my back
in a snow-drift; the animal which I had been
riding was pawing the air with his fore-legs, like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
a spaniel the first time he is thrown into the
water; before any one could reach my horse's
head, over he fell—the soft substance fortunately
saving my body from the effects of the
collision. It appeared that I had strayed half a
yard or so from the track, hence this disaster.
The Zaptieh in front of our party dismounted,
taking a wand, six feet in length, from his saddle-bow,
he began to advance with great caution,
and to probe the ground before him at every step
he took.
</p>

<p>
"There are deep holes," said Mohammed,
wading through the snow to my assistance. "If
we fall down one of them we shall remain there,
and in the summer the eagles will pick our bones.
It will be better for all of us to walk and lead
the horses," he continued. "Even then we shall
have great difficulty in effecting a passage. The
chief Zaptieh has been saying that it would be
better if we were to return to Kotnu and try to
cross the mountains to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
The snow had recommenced falling; it was
difficult to see what lay before us. However, we
had accomplished more than half of the day's
march. In all probability the path would soon
become more difficult. I determined at all
hazards to push on, and the more particularly as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
I had no time to waste, owing to my limited leave
of absence. Forward we waded through the
gradually-rising drifts. Each man followed his
neighbour in Indian file; presently the leading
Zaptieh who was engaged in sounding the path
before him, buried the six-feet wand in the snow;
he thrust his elbow down after the stick; there
was still no bottom. We were off the track. A
false step might at any moment send us down
the chasm. A consultation took place between
the Zaptiehs, the head man urging forcibly upon
our party the necessity of returning. But when
we faced the other way, the wind cut against
our eyes with great violence. The particles of
snow were so blinding that it was clearly much
more dangerous to return than to proceed.
</p>

<p>
"It is our fate!" remarked the chief Zaptieh
to the comrade by his side.
</p>

<p>
"Destruction seize the giaour who may be the
cause of all our deaths!" said another.
</p>

<p>
"Let him die of the plague!" added a third.
</p>

<p>
This rather strong language was uttered in a
loud tone, and as if the speakers did not care
whether their observations met my ear or not.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what it is!" I cried rather sternly
to my unruly followers, and at the same time
drawing my revolver; "I cannot reach you with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
my whip; but if you make any more insulting
remarks, I shall send a bullet in your direction to
teach you manners!"
</p>

<p>
"For the sake of heaven be quiet!" cried
Mohammed to the Zaptiehs—for he, being directly
in the line of fire, did not wish to expose himself
as a shield to the delinquents.
</p>

<p>
"There will be no baksheesh unless you are as
docile as horses," continued my Turkish servant.
</p>

<p>
This last remark, combined with my threat—which,
it is needless to say, I had no intention to
put into execution—brought the guides to their
senses. Presently the stick of the leading Zaptieh
struck against the track, and, after wading
through the snow for some three hours more, we
descended the side of the mountain. The snow
disappeared as we reached the vale below, and
deep mud, reaching above our knees, covered the
track before us. It was terrible hard work for
the baggage-horses. One of them, stumbling,
fell prostrate in the mire. No amount of pressure
would induce him to get up; so, taking off his
pack-saddle and dividing the baggage as best we
could—placing some on the saddle-horses and
carrying the rest ourselves—we struggled on to a
glimmering light which marked our quarters for
the night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The village of Yarbasan was reached. Sending
back some of the villagers for the abandoned
animal, I prepared to make myself as comfortable
as the circumstances would allow.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime Radford and Mohammed were
busily engaged in unloading the other baggage-horse.
The pack-saddle was too broad to pass
through the narrow gateway; all the luggage had
to be unstrapped in the street—such a street as it
was too! Imagine a farm-yard of the dirtiest
description, and without any straw to absorb the
filthy refuse; but even this does not convey
to my own mind the hideous state of the road
through Yarbasan. The inhabitants possessed
many cattle, which were each evening driven into
the village, so as to be out of the way of
wolves. It had never occurred to the mind of the
oldest villager to remove the deposits of their
cows and oxen. If a farmer wished to pay a visit
to a neighbour across the way, he simply tucked
up his dressing-gown under his arm-pits, took
off his slippers, broad trousers, and stockings,
then, committing himself to Providence, he
would wade through the dirt to his friend's
house.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you not clean the street?" I
inquired of my host, an old Turk, who, having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
just come in from the country, was rubbing his
legs with some straw before the fire.
</p>

<p>
"The mud will dry up in the summer months,"
replied the man; "why trouble our heads about
it now?"
</p>

<p>
The inside of the dwelling was not so clean as
an average pig-sty. Horses, oxen, cows, and
sheep were stowed away in the same room as ourselves.
The Zaptiehs had squatted down in one
corner with the host, Radford and Mohammed lay
stretched out in the middle of the floor.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes a woman arrived from some
other house in the neighbourhood. She was clad
in a long strip of cloth, which enveloped the
upper part of her body; her legs and feet were
covered with mud. Putting down a large wooden
tray, on which were several thin cakes of half-cooked
paste, and a basinful of oily soup, she
retired. The proprietor of the house, after
offering the dishes to me, returned to the Zaptiehs.
In the meantime, closing my eyes, I tried to doze
off to sleep. Presently the gendarmes thought that
I was in the land of Somnus, and my attention
was aroused by the familiar term of "giaour."
</p>

<p>
"Only think of our being ordered to accompany
an infidel to Divriki in the winter!"
observed the chief of the party.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' name='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and for him to threaten to whip us!"
said the other.
</p>

<p>
"He would have done it too," said Mohammed,
joining in the conversation. "My Effendi is not
like the Christians about here. He is an
Inglis!"
</p>

<p>
"So the Inglis giaours are different to the
Armenian giaours?" observed the Zaptieh.
</p>

<p>
"Very different: the Armenians talk, but the
Inglis strike. Hush! hush! we shall awake him!"—and
the conversation gradually died away in a
whisper.

</p>

<p>
The baggage-horse was very little the worse for
his long march of ten hours on the previous day.
Yarbasan was not a lively place to stop at, I
determined to push on to Divriki.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>334</a></span>
</p>

<p>
We passed a range of hills—red-coloured stones
lying in profusion along the track—and, descending
a deep incline, arrived on the banks of the river
Dumrudja (Kumer Su), a rapid stream, here about
fifty yards wide. A quantity of wood was floating
on the waters. This had been cut in the pine-forests
higher up the channel, and afterwards been
tossed into the river to find its way to Divriki.
There was no bridge over the stream, the water
being more than four feet deep. A consultation
took place amongst the Zaptiehs.
</p>

<p>
"What are they talking about?" I inquired of
Mohammed.
</p>

<p>
"Effendi, they say that if any one of our horses
were to stumble, it would be a bad thing for the
rider. There is a waterfall a few hundred yards
down the stream."
</p>

<p>
The large pieces of timber which were whirling
round and round in the middle of the river were
also a source of anxiety, for should any of these
huge beams strike a horse, the animal would have
been swept off his legs for a certainty. After a
minute or two spent in consideration, the Zaptiehs
determined to cross the river, every horseman
riding abreast of his companion. The stream
would then press against the outside horse; he,
however, would be supported by the one alongside
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' name='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
him; each animal, in turn, being assisted by the
other quadrupeds of the party.
</p>

<p>
It was as much as our horses could do to reach
the opposite bank. After several thanksgivings
to the all-merciful Allah, we once more began to
climb into the clouds. A dense mist prevailed.
Presently almost everything was hidden from our
view. The snow became deeper and more binding;
at last the pack-horses came to a standstill.
Unloading the baggage-animals, we distributed
the luggage amidst the saddle-horses, and, wading
onward, continued our march through the snow.
This in some places was nearly breast high.
</p>

<p>
On the summit of the mountain stood a little
house built of rocks, which were loosely piled the
one upon the other; and, resting here for a minute
or so to recover our breath, I was informed
that it had been erected by a charitable Turk in
Divriki, as a shelter for benighted travellers.
</p>

<p>
"Blessings on his head!" said the Zaptieh
who gave me the information. "This shelter has
saved several lives already. If we had arrived
here two hours later, it might have been the
means of saving our own. The wind is rising,"
he continued, "and the sooner we reach Divriki
the better."
</p>

<p>
Presently the little town appears in sight; a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' name='Page_336' href='#Page_336'>336</a></span>
thin skirt of poplar-trees encircles it as in a frame.
An old ruined citadel, perched up on a seemingly
inaccessible rock, faces us from the opposite
side of Divriki. A tower on a still higher peak,
but communicating by a hidden path with the
citadel, serves as a place of refuge for the
garrison, should the first-mentioned stronghold
ever be taken by assault. A rapid stream—the
Tchalt Tchai—runs below the citadel. The town
is said to contain about 3400 houses, of which
3000 belong to Turks, and the remainder to
Armenians.
</p>

<p>
Behind the houses and in the distance were fresh
layers of snow-covered mountains: the valley in
which the town lies had not felt the onslaught of
winter; it was still covered with deep mud.
</p>

<p>
One of the Zaptiehs galloped forward with
a letter to the governor from the Pacha at Sivas.
Presently the official rode out to meet me. He was
accompanied by an escort of gendarmes under the
command of a captain. The latter, who was
mounted upon a spirited little Arab, caracoled
his steed to and fro—now bending over the saddle
and trying to touch the ground with his hand—then
going through all the motions of throwing
the Djerrid—evidently wishing to astonish the
weak nerves of the newly-arrived giaours.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337' href='#Page_337'>337</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Lor! what a cropper!"
</p>

<p>
This remark from my English servant disturbed
me in a conversation with the governor. On
looking round, I saw the captain rolling in the
mud. His saddle had turned—hence the fall.
</p>

<p>
"Serve him right, sir!" remarked Radford,
catching my eye. "He was a spurring his horse
that cruel; now pulling him up short on his
withers, and then loosing him off like an express
train. He was trying to show us how he could
touch the ground. I believe, sir, the fellow
thinks that we know nothing about riding, and
that is why he wanted to do a Astley's performance
out here in Hasia!"
</p>

<p>
The Caimacan led the way to a large house,
belonging to a Turkish gentleman, a personal
friend of the Pacha of Sivas. My host received
me very courteously. He was under the impression
that I had come to Divriki on some
business connected with mines, and seemed surprised
when he was informed that nothing but a
wish to see the country had induced me to ride
through Anatolia.
</p>

<p>
"There are mines in the neighbourhood," said
the Turk, "and, according to tradition, some very
rich ones. They were worked several hundred
years ago—that is, when people lived who had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
brains—but now, alas! every man's head is like
a blown-out calf's skin. The people do not know
how to get at the treasures which lie hid beneath
the ground, and, even if they did, would be too
idle to do so."
</p>

<p>
I observed that, judging from the ruins about
Divriki, all the houses must formerly have been
built of hewn stone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said my host sorrowfully, "our ancestors
were wise men. They lived in stone houses,
we are satisfied with buildings made of dried
mud. What do you build your houses of in
England?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Of bricks made of clay burnt in a fire."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, said the Turk, "you English have
advanced. You know more than your grandfathers.
Why have we not done the same?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably because you keep your women shut
up in a harem, and do not educate them," I
replied. "Turkish mothers are very ignorant,
and, consequently, cannot instruct their children.
The result is that your sons are only half educated.
Besides this, you choose your wives—at least I
am told so—for their looks, and without any
regard to their attainments."
</p>

<p>
"The Inglis is quite right," said an old Turk,
a friend of my host. "If I want to breed a good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
foal, I am as particular about the mare as the
sire. He means that we leave the mares out of
the question, and then complain that our stock
is not so good as that of other nations."
</p>

<p>
"But hundreds of years ago our women knew
quite as much as the Frank women," observed my
host.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied his companion, "and then we
could hold our own against the Franks. But the
Frank women have been educated since those
times; the Effendi thinks that we ought to
educate our wives in the same way."
</p>

<p>
"It would be difficult to do so," said the Turk
coldly. "Their women uncover their faces; I
have heard that some of them declare that they are
the equals of their husbands. What ridiculous
creatures they must be," he continued, "not at
once to accept that inferior position which Allah
in His wisdom has awarded to them!"
</p>

<p>
The following day I walked to the citadel,
accompanied by my host. The building had been
erected 600 years ago, as a defence against the
Persians, who at that time frequently made encroachments
into this part of Turkey. The solid
masonry, which in many places had been allowed
to go to ruin, showed that the walls had been
originally built with great care. Two thousand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
men could have been quartered in the citadel,
which now, uninhabited save by dogs and lizards,
is rapidly succumbing to the elements. Convenient
embrasures had been left on that side
of the rampart which was easiest to assault;
through them the defenders could pour down the
celebrated Greek fire so much used in the middle
ages.
</p>

<p>
The river, which ran below the citadel, separated
us from the tower which was used as a final place
of retreat should the citadel be stormed. On my
asking how the garrison could cross the water,
there being no bridge in the vicinity, I was
informed that a subterranean passage led beneath
the stream to the other bank, and, then entering
the side of the rock, a winding staircase gave
access to the tower. The defenders were thus
able to retreat from the citadel without their
movements being seen by the enemy.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious afternoon. The view of
Divriki, of its numerous minarets and domes,
lying as it were in miniature below us, was very
lovely. Lofty mountains, in winter garb, surrounded
the suburbs on every side; and the
silvery river, threading its way through the more
distant quarters of the town, bubbled and splashed
against the rocks and boulders. The murmur
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' name='Page_341' href='#Page_341'>341</a></span>
of the waters was blended with the hum of the
population. The cries of the herdsmen mingled
ever and anon with the report of a fire-arm in the
distance.
</p>

<p>
"Is there much game in the neighbourhood?"
I inquired of my companion, who, leaning against
one of the battlements in the tower, was straining
his eyes in the direction of the shot.
</p>

<p>
"No. A few wild goats are sometimes to be
seen on the rocks. The sportsman, whoever he
is, has probably managed to come upon some
of them unawares. I have a beautiful gun," he
continued; "I will show it you afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"Is it for partridges or for big game?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"For big game. It is rifled," he replied, "but
I often load it with shot, and shoot at partridges,
that is when they are all huddled together on the
ground. Do you shoot much in your country
with ball?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; there is a great meeting once a year
near London. All the best marksmen attend, and
the Queen gives a prize to the best shot."
</p>

<p>
"Does she give many paras?"
</p>

<p>
"A great many—several hundred liras."
</p>

<p>
"Now could one of your best shots hit that
cow?" pointing to an animal about 400 yards
distant.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"What a marvel!" said the Turk. "Even the
Kurds could not do that, and they shoot very
well. They manufacture their own powder," he
continued, "and very good powder it is too. The
powder sold by the permission of our Government
is very bad and dear; besides that, a man is
only permitted to purchase a very small quantity
at a time. There is plenty of sulphur, saltpetre,
and charcoal in the mountains, and the Kurds
supply themselves."
</p>

<p>
I afterwards learnt that all the powder which
is furnished to the troops in Asia Minor is sent
from Constantinople. There is no gunpowder
manufactory in this part of Asia Minor. It is a
great pity that the Turks have not long ago
started an arsenal in the neighbourhood of
Erzingan, which could have supplied the troops
on the Turko-Russian frontier with cartridges
and small-arms. As it is, every cartridge
served out to a soldier before Kars costs the
Government fifty per cent in addition to its
original cost, owing to the difficulties of transport.
</p>

<p>
"The Pacha at Sivas wrote to me to make
your stay at Divriki as pleasant as I could,"
presently remarked my companion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"How did you like him?" observed an Armenian
who now joined us.
</p>

<p>
"Very much."
</p>

<p>
"He is civil to all Europeans," continued the
Armenian. "Probably he took a fancy to you
because his astrologer had worked out your
horoscope, and had reported favourably upon it."
</p>

<p>
"You do not mean to say that the Pacha
believes in such things?" I observed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; he never makes a journey without first
of all consulting his astrologer."
</p>

<p>
There was no very active trade in Divriki.
The Armenians supplied the people of the town
with the few goods which they might require at
exorbitant prices.
</p>

<p>
In addition to this, most of the Christians were
usurers. Any Mohammedan who chanced to
require a loan had to pay his Armenian fellow-citizen
a very high rate of interest. However, in
this respect, Divriki is not an exception to the
towns in Anatolia, and in almost every district
which I visited I found that the leading Christians
in the community had made their money by
usurious dealings. In some instances, old Turkish
families had been entirely ruined, their descendants
were lying in gaol at the suit of Armenian money-lenders.

<p class="ch_summ">
Usury laws in Turkey—An Armenian in prison for debt—The
Caimacan—The Turkish creditor—Hanistan Ereek's father—A
Government cannot be imprisoned for debt—The redif
soldiers—Their unwillingness to serve—The Armenians
not to be trusted—Yanoot—A picture of desolation—A

Crimean war.
</p>

<p>
I was now to learn that the usury laws in Turkey
are also used against the Christians. On returning
to my house, a servant informed me that an
Armenian was downstairs, and wished to see me.
</p>

<p>
He had been in Paris, and could speak a little
French. This he so interlarded with Turkish
that it was rather difficult to follow him. The
man's name was Hanistan Ereek. At length I
discovered that, twelve years ago, his father
had borrowed 300 piastres from a Turk. Soon
afterwards the father died, and the son, leaving
Divriki without paying the debt, had gone to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' name='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
Europe. On his return, the creditor had him
arrested for the sum of 6000 piastres. This
Hanistan Ereek refused to pay; he had been imprisoned
for three months in consequence.
</p>

<p>
The Caimacan was in the room at the time the
man made his complaint.
</p>

<p>
"It seems a hard case," I remarked.
</p>

<p>
"It is our law," was the reply; "if he had
been a Turk, the same thing would have happened."
</p>

<p>
"No, it would not have happened! 300 piastres
could never have amounted to 6000 piastres!"
cried the Armenian indignantly.
</p>

<p>
It appeared that the case was one of hard swearing.
The Turkish creditor had produced a piece
of paper, on which was written that he had lent
a larger amount than 300 piastres to Hanistan
Ereek's father—the document in question bearing
the latter's signature. This the son swore was a
forgery. However, the Turk had been believed,
and the Armenian had been sent to prison.
</p>

<p>
"What would have been done if this case had
happened in your country?" asked the Caimacan;
"would you not have put the man in prison for
debt?"
</p>

<p>
"No; a son is not liable for his father's
debts."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Well, each country has its own laws, which
doubtless are good for the respective inhabitants,"
observed the governor; "but if my father had
died owing a sum of money, I should have thought
that it was my duty to pay it."
</p>

<p>
"A very proper resolution," I remarked; "but
supposing that a Government has contracted a
debt, do you not think that its successors are
bound to pay the interest of the loan?"
</p>

<p>
The Caimacan stroked his beard and looked at
the Cadi, who presently answered,—
</p>

<p>
"We could not put a Government in prison."
</p>

<p>
"No," I observed, "but your nation owes my
nation more than a hundred millions of liras, and
not only you do not pay us any interest, but you
have even proposed to repudiate the debt altogether!"
</p>

<p>
"How can we pay?" said the Cadi; "we have
no gold, only caime, and your people will not take
that. When the Russians leave us alone, then
we shall be able to pay."
</p>

<p>
"And in the meantime I suppose I am to go
back to prison?" said the Armenian.
</p>

<p>
"We shall see," said the Caimacan gravely;
"the law must be carried out."
</p>

<p>
I have, perhaps, given the above case more
prominence than it deserves, but I have done so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' name='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
because in this instance the governor of Divriki
and a Christian were confronted in my presence,
and the Armenian made his complaint without
the slightest hesitation or fear. Now if the
Christians had been so ill-treated as some of
their co-religionists would have had me believe
Hanistan Ereek would not have been likely to have
dared to come forward and find fault with the
Cadi of his town, who had adjudicated upon the
matter.
</p>

<p>
According to the governor, the people in his
district had not shown much readiness to go to
the war. In some of the villages, the redif
soldiery were very reluctant to leave their homes,
and could only be made to do so by the Zaptiehs
of the province, who were most of them engaged
at present in this duty.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you not give the Armenians arms?"
I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"They would turn them against us, and join the
Russians," was the governor's reply. "In some
districts which are very near Russia, and where
the Armenians have the opportunity of seeing the
Russians as they are, and not as they pretend to
be, the Christians prefer being under the Turkish
rule; but the Armenians in our central provinces
are constantly being tampered with by Russian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' name='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
agents. If we were to give the Christians arms,
Allah only knows what would take place!"
</p>

<p>
I left Divriki at daybreak the following morning,
and continued the march towards Arabkir.
</p>

<p>
We ascended once more into the clouds, and,
after a four hours' ride, halted to bait our horses
at the village of Yanoot—if, indeed, it deserves
the name of village—for it consists of a few huts,
and about twenty-five inhabitants make up the
entire population.
</p>

<p>
Now a curious phenomenon presented itself before
us. We were passing a chain of hills which
traversed our track from north to south. The
northern side of every height was covered with
deep snow, on the southern declivities some
igneous rocks were exposed to view and glared in
the sun. Here the rays were so fierce that not
only there was no snow, but the weather became
oppressively warm. A few hundred yards further,
and winter attacked us again in all its rigour.
Our horses were tried to their utmost in forcing a
way before them.
</p>

<p>
The road became very rugged. An immense
quantity of loose sharp pebbles were lying on
the track. Our horses could not see them and
were constantly falling on their knees. Not a
village or solitary house was met with during
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' name='Page_349' href='#Page_349'>349</a></span>
our march. It was a picture of desolation. A
few magpies, which from time to time flew mournfully
across the path, were the only living things
besides ourselves.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, this is a Jordan of a road," remarked
my servant Radford, referring to some
popular song, as the horse he rode fell down
for the fifth time that morning. "That cemetery
in Constantinople, where we tried the
'osses, was a bad place for riding, but it was
nothing to this. Mohammed, he don't seem to
take any account of it whatever. I never see
such fellows as these Turks; they don't seem to
be able to muster a grumble amongst them, no
matter what they may have to undergo! Why,
sir, some of them soldiers as we saw at Sivas
had not received a day's pay for twenty-five
months, and they seemed quite content and happy
like; whilst, as for rations, it is true that the
men fill themselves to bursting when they have
the chance, but when they have to go without
their grub they don't grumble! I wonder, sir,
what our soldiers at Aldershot would say if they
had not received a ha'p'orth of pay for two years,
and had to march sometimes from morning to
night, with nothing inside them save a whiff or
so of tobacco?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>350</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Radford was right in his remark about the
track being a Jordan road—that is, if a Jordan
road is the quintessence of everything that is
stony and disagreeable. We had to lead our
horses. Hour after hour sped by; we still
seemed to be no nearer to any signs of Arabkir.
Now we were up to our waists in snow and
quagmire, and then we were lying between our
horses' heels, the result of a slip from some half-hidden
boulder.
</p>

<p>
At last we arrived at a spot close to the town.
Here the rocks were of a crimson hue, their
sides were covered with pebbles of ebon blackness.
We mounted our horses, and, riding along
a precipice-bounded path which leads into the
long straggling city, presently halted at the house
of an Armenian gentleman, who was kind enough
to offer us a lodging for the night.
</p>

<p>
My host was a silk-merchant. He had started
in business a very few years previous. This district
being suitable for breeding silk-worms, he
had speedily amassed a fortune. He was now one
of the wealthiest men in the province, and not only
supplied the Arabkir district with textures of his
manufacture, but sent them by caravans to the
limits of Asia Minor. He was very much
respected by the Mohammedans in the town,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' name='Page_351' href='#Page_351'>351</a></span>
and was on the best of terms with the Caimacan.
The latter, when he heard of my arrival, called,
and, after salaaming my host, told him that he
should stay to dinner.
</p>

<p>
The apartment set aside for my use was hung
round with engravings of all the sovereigns in
Europe. A book-shelf in one corner was filled
with French books, none of which my host could
read.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know French?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"No!"
</p>

<p>
"Then what is the good of those volumes to
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for my ignorance," replied the man,
"but I mean to have my child sent to Constantinople;
there he shall learn French, and afterwards
he will be able to read to me what is inside these
books. Pretty covers, are they not?" he continued,
pointing to the binding. "I bought them when I
was residing at Erzeroum, and the merchant told
me that they were full of wisdom. I have a
European servant," he added.
</p>

<p>
"A Frenchman?"
</p>

<p>
"No, a Russian."
</p>

<p>
"A Russian!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. You may well be surprised," he said, "for
there is not much love lost between the Russians
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_352' name='Page_352' href='#Page_352'>352</a></span>
and ourselves. This man was taken prisoner
during the Crimean war. When it was over he
preferred remaining with us to returning to his
own country."

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
